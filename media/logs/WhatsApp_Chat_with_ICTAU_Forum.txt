Alex was walking and he asked God for money. He said: " God, if you give me 10,000/=, I'll give you 1,000/= for tithe. If you give me 100,000/=, I'll give you 10,000/=. And if you give me 1,000,000/=, I will give you 100,000/=." 
As he walked, he picked 900,000/= laughed and selfishly said: kyokka Lord, you are very clever; you have already removed yours!

3/15/17, 12:09 PM - ‪+254 790 493937‬: Privacy International just released a chilling report on how Kenya’s National Security organs, and especially the Intelligence office, carries out unregulated communication surveillance with the aid of telecommunication companies and shares this with units of law enforcement outside the legal procedures. 

-----
Key Revelations:
Communications surveillance is being carried out by Kenyan state actors, essentially without oversight, outside of the procedures required by Kenyan laws. Intercepted communications content and data are used to facilitate gross human rights abuses - to spy on, profile, locate, track and ultimately arrest, torture, kill or 'disappear' suspects.
Intelligence gained by intercepting phone communications, primarily by the National Intelligence Service (NIS), is regularly shared with units of the police to carry out counter-terrorism operations, particularly the GSU-Recce company and Anti-Terrorism Police Unit (ATPU). These police units have well-documented records of abuses including torture and extrajudicial killing
Despite constitutional and other privacy protections, telecommunications operators regularly hand over customer data to both intelligence and law enforcement agencies. Sources who spoke with PI feel that they cannot decline agencies’ requests.
The NIS appears to have direct access to communication networks across Kenya. Direct access means an actor has backdoor access the phone communications that flow through service providers. In this case, it is unlikely that the network operators had knowledge of the state's interception.
NIS officers use various techniques to access both call content and call data records, including using mobile interception devices. Further methods are documented in the report.
Law enforcement agents are present within telecommunications operators’ facilities with the providers’ knowledge. NIS are also informally present in the telecommunication operators’ facilities, apparently undercover, according to current and former telecommunications, Communications Authority and NIS staff interviewed by Privacy International. This investigation details both the 'above the board' and informal practices. Agency and company responses to requests for comment by Privacy International are included in the report.
In advance of the August 2017 Presidential elections, the Communications Authority has launched several disturbing initiatives, including a project to monitor social media content, whose potential capacities are discussed in this report.

Ok no one....bye
3/15/17, 1:36 PM - ‪+256 755 425707‬: Rules:
1. The ICTAU WhatsApp Group is strictly for ICTAU FORUM MEMBERS to share instantaneous alerts and updates that are ICT-Uganda Related and that serve to grow and develop the ICT community in Uganda.
2. We will restrict ourselves to matters that are specific to ICT ONLY. Whereas issues of a national nature might be of interest to members, these can be shared using other fora.
3. All members must communicate to the Group and not to individuals within the Group. Anyone wishing to communicate to an individual should DM (Direct Message) or Inbox directly.
4. There will be no sharing of jokes, forwards, memes, comics or videos that are not strictly ICT related. This is because we might be disparate - culturally, religiously, etc - and rather than risk offending any member with content that they might find wrong or offensive, we should avoid it altogether  
​5. The forum will not involve or accept messages to do with Politics, Religion and Marketing of products and services. All these can be accommodated in general forums elsewhere.
3/15/17, 1:39 PM - ‪+256 774 518922‬: According to the rules, jokes that are ICT related are ok. If that's a misunderstanding on my part, the rules should explicitly say so.
3/15/17, 1:42 PM - ‪+256 772 656158‬: On. Point
3/15/17, 1:48 PM - Harvy Mugisha Peter: 👊🏾

3/15/17, 2:09 PM - ‪+256 778 332148‬: Atte, don't remove me😡😡
3/15/17, 2:50 PM - ‪+256 782 746696‬: The group is not that tough/serious. A few of my siblings are in groups where with their rules applied here the fines would already be in millions ( I have counted). I am told some clan groups even have physical caning as a penalty.
3/15/17, 2:57 PM - ‪+256 784 805273‬: This to those who are members of the Internet Society of Uganda and could  have missed this.

3/15/17, 5:04 PM - ‪+256 776 553260‬: A question why focus on low cost assembly that can be done better anywhere else. As a country we need to move to higher value services that leverage our comparative advantage...

3/15/17, 5:05 PM - ‪+256 776 665999‬: Really;we can do bricks if its the bricks I know

3/15/17, 5:10 PM - ‪+256 702 926323‬: we have to start somewhere, its very important to start then we will learn and take it from there. If we don't start how do we even know we can/can't ?

3/15/17, 5:17 PM - ‪+256 774 345394‬: True we just need to start and goodthing with electronics every component is on market making assembly very easy
3/15/17, 5:18 PM - ‪+256 704 179474‬: For assembling in think for now we can but manufacturing it will take some good years and too much effort will be needed starting from our education system making it more of practical than theoretical
3/15/17, 5:20 PM - ‪+256 774 345394‬: Manufacturing no nid but we can also do it with better recycling infrastructure
3/15/17, 5:25 PM - ‪+256 782 619812‬: Sorry to interrupt: Someone just called me to clarify membership fees. Here is the link: http://ictau.ug/membership-fees-structure-and-benefits/  Company fees are currently subject to a discount so for 2017 the rate is 400,000.
3/15/17, 5:27 PM - ‪+256 704 179474‬: Okay leave alone manufacturing bt if up to now we still hav fresh graduates who can't even install an operating system on to r machine or even share r folder or printer on r LAN network then I think we have are huge problem i think these are the issues that must be addressed first before we even think of manufacturing or assembling computer hardware
3/15/17, 5:29 PM - ‪+256 778 332148‬: Very true, am a victim. Truth be told, I have a theory degree
3/15/17, 5:29 PM - ‪+256 700 981853‬: 100% true, I have colleagues with BIT but can't configure a printer I think it's our curriculum
3/15/17, 5:29 PM - ‪+256 792 801124‬: Does Uganda have a condusive environment for setting up a computer manufacturing plant? Do we have enough manpower/resources? What's the cost of doing business in Ug (a unit of electricity rises every month - don't ask me how Yaka is calculated)?  If Intel asks for 200 computer engineers, can we provide them?  Is the market ready for such? Are the policy makers ready for such when they still us to send emails to their yahoo addresses and not go.ug? Why choose Uganda over her neighbors like Kenya or Tz or even SA down south that is more advanced?
3/15/17, 5:31 PM - ‪+256 700 981853‬: Be4 thinking of computer manufacturing plant, do we have well trained people? A graduate of computer engineering who can't network is still below expectations
3/15/17, 5:33 PM - ‪+256 774 345394‬: @Derrick me in this case I blame students not the education system coz no system can ever limit ur exploration of the field
3/15/17, 5:33 PM - ‪+256 701 410715‬: I hate this talk, who should we blame for graduates who can't install an operating system?
3/15/17, 5:34 PM - ‪+256 774 345394‬: Its the students themselves
3/15/17, 5:35 PM - ‪+256 774 345394‬: Me I always tell those who can't install an operatin system to simply learn how to..because the ICT field is about learning and equipping yourself with new things
3/15/17, 5:36 PM - ‪+254 790 493937‬: There you are. It seems, there is a gap somewhere for opportunities for students to innovate after college/uni
3/15/17, 5:37 PM - ‪+256 701 410715‬: Our teaching system is too theoretical, ICT institutions don't even have enough computers and software for students to explore
3/15/17, 5:37 PM - ‪+256 778 332148‬: Am lost in this relym
3/15/17, 5:39 PM - Harvy Mugisha Peter: V
3/15/17, 5:40 PM - ‪+256 701 410715‬: The issue is, who to blame for fresh graduates who can't even install an operating system
3/15/17, 5:41 PM - ‪+256 774 345394‬: Should we say the system selected a few and equipped them with knowledge like installing the OS
3/15/17, 5:41 PM - ‪+256 774 345394‬: Me I strongly blame the people who can read and can't learn
3/15/17, 5:41 PM - ‪+256 784 391232‬: I think mentioning an OS you're going to far. Say a software program
3/15/17, 5:42 PM - ‪+254 790 493937‬: OK what's the solution?
3/15/17, 5:43 PM - ‪+256 778 332148‬: We may blame fresh graduates, but have u realized students backgrounds that 2/10, can afford to buy themselves computers for a 3yr course, have u realized leactures too are more theoretical than practical??  All these things contribute to the failure.
3/15/17, 5:43 PM - ‪+256 784 391232‬: The problem is still with the institutions and the competence of the students
3/15/17, 5:44 PM - ‪+256 774 345394‬: But Universities have computer labs
3/15/17, 5:44 PM - ‪+256 774 518922‬: Really...if the Training isn't offered while pursuing your degree, go look for it, learn. How comes there are people who are knowledgeable and skilled. Did they have Divine intervention?  Please stop making excuses for individual shortcomings. Take responsibility and work on them. Some of us first saw computers for the 1st time in campus but the work we are able to do is pretty amazing.
3/15/17, 5:44 PM - ‪+256 778 332148‬: 2. The environment these fresh graduates are exposed after school, many want to earn a living, IT jobs are rare, someone can't sit on street waiting for a job, they divert to other things, marketing, sales, bssn etc.... Thurs,
3/15/17, 5:45 PM - ‪+256 701 410715‬: 😂😂 the number of available computers in our institutions is low than the students.
3/15/17, 5:45 PM - ‪+254 790 493937‬: Question: can they create jobs?
3/15/17, 5:45 PM - ‪+256 774 345394‬: Very true and I strongly support this
3/15/17, 5:46 PM - ‪+256 784 391232‬: Right about the theory, for instance I took it at Makerere, but the access to practicals was a mess throughout.
3/15/17, 5:46 PM - ‪+256 778 332148‬: How often do u access those computers, what do u do at night when the Labs are closed,??  Eating and watching movies, and read your theory.  U can cram things for exams, but practically, empty headed
3/15/17, 5:47 PM - ‪+256 774 345394‬: Internet cafes still exist and surprisingly people go in for social media...😔😔😔😔
3/15/17, 5:47 PM - ‪+256 784 391232‬: 🙇🏾😂😂
3/15/17, 5:48 PM - ‪+256 774 518922‬: Let's be practical. You don't need 8hrs a week to get comfortable with  Linux system administration, you need a few consistent time blocks. Those Labs you talk about were many people got their 1st start
3/15/17, 5:48 PM - ‪+256 701 410715‬: 😂😂😂😂
3/15/17, 5:48 PM - ‪+256 704 179474‬: ICT is nt jus abt OS it's very wide but I think after you graduate you should be perfect or atleast good at something that is IT based if you join the field these specialities you hav will attract pipo better than you in other fields  u will learn a lot from them in the due course u will be pro doing alot of staff that you dint even knw r thing abt
3/15/17, 5:49 PM - ‪+256 782 131330‬: Come on Gordon u can read abt something en uno stand properly but still if u lack dat hands on experience u will forget like u have never read abt it
3/15/17, 5:49 PM - ‪+256 774 345394‬: Now this is the most important line...job creation
3/15/17, 5:49 PM - ‪+256 778 332148‬: Besides,  what is the incense of studying a course and no jobs ( bse a few can afford to start small IT bssn on there own, after school).  Why don't we talk about job creation for these people first......  Skills might be there but on a smaller rate, but where to apply them so u can grow day by day..... Is going to market someone's bssn, and earning 10k, per week.  So, I don't blame students at all.
3/15/17, 5:49 PM - ‪+256 773 374513‬: I have been mulling over the curse of a nation, and my time in NYC so far has led me to realise, the bible is accurate when it says, a people perish for lack of a vision -

3/15/17, 5:50 PM - ‪+256 702 563331‬: I agree with non of you, Most of the students are never do their courses of preference.
They are forced by family or Situations and End up failing to Explore the opportunities affiliated to the courses.

Do you think most of the students know the purpose of Industrial(Internship) Training.
3/15/17, 5:50 PM - ‪+256 700 981853‬: Students r not to blame, they r not given good education
3/15/17, 5:50 PM - ‪+256 700 981853‬: Compare a computer science student of Makerere n one of India
3/15/17, 5:50 PM - ‪+256 700 981853‬: They r not given proper training at university
3/15/17, 5:51 PM - ‪+256 778 332148‬: And more so, where are the jobs that will push them to improve there skills??
3/15/17, 5:52 PM - ‪+254 790 493937‬: No excuse to produce half baked students
3/15/17, 5:52 PM - ‪+256 778 332148‬: Personally, I just found out I passionately loving photography staff, media more of presenting than the IS course I did.  There are many reasons why we are Failing in this ICT relym
3/15/17, 6:00 PM - ‪+256 701 410715‬: Do you think the ICT ministry, NitaU and ICTAU have the capability to Uplift the ICT dream in Uganda and HOW? 

*Not political* just asking
3/15/17, 6:02 PM - ‪+256 774 345394‬: Only if some policies are structured for the sector
3/15/17, 6:02 PM - ‪+256 792 801124‬: ICT or IT is not really much about the course you study. We have lots of ICT entrepreneurs, good programmers, network admins, system analysts who have never stepped into a CS 101 class or studied a different course.  Can many of us master the courage to learn the necessary skills and be counted among the "men"?
3/15/17, 6:02 PM - ‪+256 772 181685‬: In their dreams yes.
3/15/17, 6:03 PM - ‪+256 774 345394‬: 👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽👍🏽
3/15/17, 6:03 PM - ‪+254 790 493937‬: Is there a problem or inadequacy in the UG ICT market itself?
3/15/17, 6:03 PM - ‪+256 772 181685‬: But really, In my opinion you learn 60% from university and 40% percent is purely your effort through endless research and practice
3/15/17, 6:04 PM - ‪+256 774 345394‬: true and actually its 20% from University and 80% personal effort
3/15/17, 6:05 PM - ‪+256 782 619812‬: Each of those have a specific mandate. And with each one doing their bits, YES, they WILL "uplift the dream". (Not sure what that means).

How about the mandate of each of us as an individual?
3/15/17, 6:05 PM - ‪+256 772 181685‬: Point
3/15/17, 6:06 PM - ‪+256 782 619812‬: I believe each one of us has a role to play. Directly and through engagement with those organizations
3/15/17, 6:21 PM - ‪+256 772 533848‬: We are in the country and we must do something to better ours lives whether the education system is good or not. We have some great IT people who went through the same system. So I think the first step isn't to find who is to blame but to take concrete steps towards fixing ourselves. 

Charity, go and learn programming. There are a few programmers here with great jobs or building good things on their own. If you're any good and you educate yourself properly and stay informed about industry trends, you will make a lot of money. 

We have many mediocre people in the industry in Uganda simply because people don't care. Even those that learn something do not do much to improve themselves. If you teach yourself and are committed, you will be okay.
3/15/17, 6:22 PM - ‪+256 778 332148‬: True 100%

3/15/17, 7:16 PM - ‪+256 782 746696‬: Speaking of this, some years ago there was a company assembling computers in Uganda. I chanced upon an old one and it was called anupam something... It is possible to do this if one can get the high quality parts in. Besides some of you are doing this on your own already. What is to keep us from doing it as a business and slapping a  brand on the casings ?
3/15/17, 8:00 PM - ‪+256 702 926323‬: The beauty of ICT/IT you need not to be looking for a job you could be doing apps for example and selling them on the App Store or you could make templates for websites/CMS and selling them online. Rather than sitting around and waiting for a job what if it does not come by now you should kno what you are good at focus on that
3/15/17, 8:03 PM - ‪+256 702 926323‬: Even RAPS computers used to do that but they are out now consumers here demand for traditional/Big brands Dell, Hp and the like
3/15/17, 8:03 PM - ‪+256 782 746696‬: A Kenyan athlete used YouTube to learn and actually gain enough skills to compete at the international stage. Imagine using that amount of data to learn to code or run networks, it should be more than enough for self teaching
3/15/17, 8:04 PM - ‪+256 782 746696‬: That is the problem we face at the moment, aesthetics and brand versus the power under the hood
3/15/17, 8:05 PM - ‪+256 755 425707‬: Speaking of which, have you looked at the number of Ugandan devs on Freelancer.com? Some people are racking $120 an hour. I think there should be a whole course unit teaching people how to work remotely.
3/15/17, 8:06 PM - ‪+256 782 746696‬: Or people providing work spaces & facilities for these guys
3/15/17, 8:09 PM - ‪+256 702 926323‬: The platforms are many and trust me you don't need a course they give enough demos to start you off may be we need to train people to think beyond the box
3/15/17, 8:10 PM - ‪+256 702 926323‬: We buy bundles on the regular for whatsapp how about spending these on freelancer or upwork
3/15/17, 8:12 PM - ‪+254 790 493937‬: In Kenya, there are over 50k remote workers mostly in ICT n the government is moving to support them because that money they are earning is benefiting their economy
3/15/17, 8:15 PM - ‪+256 772 656158‬: Hi is anyone here using odk for data collection on tablets?
3/15/17, 8:16 PM - ‪+256 773 374513‬: Freelancers is a good example, ut the notion that its for devs and/or designers defeats the ideal  to think like there's no box
3/15/17, 8:17 PM - ‪+256 773 374513‬: what the industry needs are thinkers
3/15/17, 8:17 PM - ‪+256 773 374513‬: we need to burst traditional bubbles (like every university project coming in 3rd year, or let alone having to have a web-based DBMS)
3/15/17, 8:18 PM - ‪+256 773 374513‬: as it turns out, the world of technology needs analysts, project managers, business managers, auditors, security experts
3/15/17, 8:18 PM - ‪+256 773 374513‬: if we could ask: What are the skills and experiences we want 3rd yrs to have? and then build out the 3yrs to deliver just that
3/15/17, 8:19 PM - ‪+256 773 374513‬: IT grads who cannot passionately defend a cause, if all they have is a microphone stand are not going to be worth much
3/15/17, 8:19 PM - ‪+256 784 805273‬: 👍🏾👏🏾 communicators, program/project managers etc
3/15/17, 8:19 PM - ‪+256 773 374513‬: ICT professionals who cannot inspire and mobilize sector peers, and out-of-sector partners ar not going to last long
3/15/17, 8:20 PM - ‪+256 773 374513‬: a passionate coders who cannot write a blog (read: report, journal article, conference paper) about why their prefered design environment needs a refresh (because they have fully explored it) will soon be bottom feeders
3/15/17, 8:21 PM - ‪+256 773 374513‬: this could be my experience alone, but Health, Education, Agriculture, Law, Engineering all are desperately in need of passionate IT folks, because its the information age
3/15/17, 8:22 PM - ‪+256 773 374513‬: how many 3rd years do we graduate who are even passionate about wanting to permeate technology into one of these sectors?
3/15/17, 8:22 PM - ‪+256 775 194615‬: Eeeeh
3/15/17, 8:23 PM - ‪+256 772 071651‬: Oh Brian, I couldn't agree with you more! Just like notion that innovation is a Tech thing only! 
I couldn't have articulated that view any better 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾
3/15/17, 8:23 PM - ‪+254 790 493937‬: Great! This discussion is going in the right direction!!!
3/15/17, 8:23 PM - ‪+256 773 374513‬: We need to think like there's no box - why do we not have graduate projects that question protocols? or question how certain systems work? Why dont we have graduate projects that are designed to fix the simple struggles that KCCA has
3/15/17, 8:25 PM - ‪+256 773 374513‬: If every seasoned professional here created 4 hours a week to have 3 first yr students intern with you on something at your work place, over the next 3 years, we will change the landscape -
3/15/17, 8:25 PM - ‪+256 773 374513‬: we will produce a movement of street smart graduates who are not waiting for jobs
3/15/17, 8:25 PM - ‪+256 782 746696‬: There might be ways to do that. I am not sure the schools would allow. For example giving students the option of doing real world projects instead of sitting exams in a course unit
3/15/17, 8:27 PM - ‪+256 773 374513‬: @256782746696 - thats exactly what am driving to.
3/15/17, 8:27 PM - ‪+254 790 493937‬: There r many on Luwum, William n George street
3/15/17, 8:27 PM - ‪+256 773 374513‬: That this association will wait for schools to agree to the mould of the product we need - that is a let down
3/15/17, 8:27 PM - ‪+256 775 194615‬: I know schools (secondary and tertiary) trying to do this... but with some resistance from here and there
3/15/17, 8:27 PM - ‪+256 704 195544‬: Unfortunately a good number of the students need to be paid even for being at your workshop. They prefer hanging out with their buddies at Univ or bars!
3/15/17, 8:28 PM - ‪+256 773 374513‬: we need to take the students off their hands, and bring them onto our projects - they will screw up, but thats the only way they will learn
3/15/17, 8:29 PM - ‪+256 773 374513‬: So how about we create a professional development program?
3/15/17, 8:29 PM - ‪+256 773 374513‬: an IT Leadership Development program
3/15/17, 8:30 PM - ‪+256 702 926323‬: It because all these guys study for jobs or to be employed, should we say there is no career guidance at uni?
3/15/17, 8:31 PM - ‪+256 773 374513‬: Yo admitted, you can get in - You sign a contract to show up at work (your placement org, which is a kampala based It business) - you get a small stipend, you work alongside professionals, support on projects and programs
3/15/17, 8:31 PM - ‪+256 773 374513‬: After a year, we take in a second cohort
3/15/17, 8:31 PM - ‪+256 773 374513‬: the goal is to have you industry and street ready by the time you leave
3/15/17, 8:32 PM - ‪+256 702 926323‬: With talks happening at university to sensitize these kids what's happening in the tech world and what's expected of them at graduation
3/15/17, 8:32 PM - ‪+256 773 374513‬: people need to be part of meetings, to write minutes, to understand how offices run, and how grants are won - these are the things all you seasoned professionals know actually matter, and we know they wot get them at school, and yet we are circling the stuff
3/15/17, 8:33 PM - ‪+256 702 926323‬: Question is do our colleges have such programs
3/15/17, 8:34 PM - ‪+256 773 374513‬: These students need to ride in the car with you and hear you negotiate for time on a call, they need to sit in on that partner clincher meeting you have, they need to design the slides for that new pitch you want to make - these are the things that they really need. And guess what, you are feeling busy and swamped, and on the other side of the fence we have non-starter graduates
3/15/17, 8:34 PM - ‪+256 773 374513‬: As an association, we can bridge this gap
3/15/17, 8:37 PM - ‪+256 773 374513‬: Do we have templates? yes - Micheal at IHSU is doing a program close to this. We have the failed Enterprise Uganda (so we dont make those mistakes again) - I work for a leadership development organisation, and I can see what works and what doesnt. we have places to learn from, we need to, and we can fix this!
3/15/17, 8:37 PM - ‪+256 702 926323‬: I agree, there is no intuitive I have handled a number of these on internship of the 5 only one was really passionate the rest are just sitting in and waiting for a chance to do their Facebook,
3/15/17, 8:38 PM - ‪+256 702 926323‬: If you ask of them what just happened an hour ago they can't even tell
3/15/17, 8:38 PM - ‪+256 773 374513‬: Sir, they are kids. what do you expect. But if I can work with your staff on delegation and program management, I guarantee you, your interns will have enough on their plates -
3/15/17, 8:40 PM - ‪+256 773 374513‬: Of course, once we build an exclusive program, we can bring in really passionate ones (they'll still be kids) - and as the program gains a track record for management training, quartely performance reviews...university supervisors will be coming to us
3/15/17, 8:40 PM - ‪+256 702 926323‬: So when do they grow up?   It's a capitalist economy we live in its ruthless
3/15/17, 8:42 PM - ‪+256 702 926323‬: In many of these ventures you have one shot at it you get wrong....
3/15/17, 8:42 PM - ‪+256 773 374513‬: Kids (and other big babies) grow up when they are empowered and entrusted, when rules are clear, and consequences clearer, including having a lasting impact
3/15/17, 8:44 PM - ‪+256 773 374513‬: Successful projects earn more trust, screw ups mean one needs to relearn the lesson. The goal is much bigger - your company must be able to see beyond the immediate gains of a regular employee, to learn to pay it forward - 100 well trained kids getting into the sector every year and remaining apart of a close knit network of new-breed thinkers will always provide you a pool of progressively improved professionals to pick from
3/15/17, 8:44 PM - ‪+256 773 374513‬: and the premise where this conversation started will soon be long over!
3/15/17, 8:45 PM - ‪+256 773 374513‬: Happy to share shared my thoughts, also happy to connect with someone to take this and other ideas further
3/15/17, 8:47 PM - ‪+256 702 926323‬: Yeah I agree and every window I take on interns I share my knowledge passionately even to my subordinates, it's so frustrating when you see some of these
3/15/17, 8:52 PM - ‪+256 755 425707‬: Done some projects using ODK but not using at the moment

3/16/17, 11:02 PM - ‪+256 782 619812‬: And here are the rules:

1. The ICTAU WhatsApp Group is strictly for ICTAU FORUM MEMBERS to share instantaneous alerts and updates that are ICT-Uganda Related and that serve to grow and develop the ICT community in Uganda.
2. We will restrict ourselves to matters that are specific to ICT ONLY. Whereas issues of a national nature might be of interest to members, these can be shared using other fora.
3. All members must communicate to the Group and not to individuals within the Group. Anyone wishing to communicate to an individual should DM (Direct Message) or Inbox directly.
4. There will be no sharing of jokes, forwards, memes, comics or videos that are not strictly ICT related. This is because we might be disparate - culturally, religiously, etc - and rather than risk offending any member with content that they might find wrong or offensive, we should avoid it altogether  
​5. The forum will not involve or accept messages to do with Politics, Religion and Marketing of products and services. All these can be accommodated in general forums elsewhere.

3/17/17, 10:05 AM - ‪+256 782 619812‬: REMINDER: Here are the forum rules:

1. The ICTAU WhatsApp Group is strictly for ICTAU FORUM MEMBERS to share instantaneous alerts and updates that are ICT-Uganda Related and that serve to grow and develop the ICT community in Uganda.
2. We will restrict ourselves to matters that are specific to ICT ONLY. Whereas issues of a national nature might be of interest to members, these can be shared using other fora.
3. All members must communicate to the Group and not to individuals within the Group. Anyone wishing to communicate to an individual should DM (Direct Message) or Inbox directly.
4. There will be no sharing of jokes, forwards, memes, comics or videos that are not strictly ICT related. This is because we might be disparate - culturally, religiously, etc - and rather than risk offending any member with content that they might find wrong or offensive, we should avoid it altogether  
​5. The forum will not involve or accept messages to do with Politics, Religion and Marketing of products and services. All these can be accommodated in general forums elsewhere.

Imagine you are a witness to a crime, you saw a young man running from a bank, it all happened very quickly but you were able to have a good look at his face as he ran away. Would you be able to describe his face? The answer is ‘No’.
This is how police goes about it to identify these suspects. There are currently two established systems that the police use to construct ‘facial composites’ of criminal suspects. Firstly, there are forensic artists. These people have skills in portraiture and use pencils or crayons to draw the face by hand.
Secondly, there are software packages (E-FIT and PRO-fit) which the police uses. These softwares offer a selection of ready-made parts to build a face.
In both the artist and computerized systems witnesses select individual facial features – hairstyle, face shape, eyes, brows, nose, etc. The result is a composite of facial parts.
In brief, a witness is first shown an unfamiliar target face. Later, he describes the face of the suspect to a forensic artist or computer technician, who would use cognitive interviewing techniques to help them recall, and construct the best possible composite.
Technicians must have expertise with the composite system plus good artistic skills to enhance the face (e.g. addition of stubble and wrinkles). When these composites are shown to the public, people will attempt to name the suspects in the composites.

3/21/17, 6:20 PM - ‪+254 790 493937‬: Elsewhere in East Africa: INVEST IN TREASURY BONDS FOR AS LITTLE AS Sh3, 000

Kenyans will no longer need Sh50, 000 minimum to invest in treasury bonds as the government plans to launch the mobile-phone traded M-Akiba on Thursday 23rd March. 

A bond is a loan that any Kenyan can give the government, then the government pays back the loan with interest.

 Here is what you need to know about participating in the M-Akiba bond

Minimum investment: Sh3, 000 then multiples of Sh100 after the first Sh3, 000

Maximum investment: Sh140, 000

Payment through Mpesa or Airtel Money

The bond will be on sale from 23rd March to 10th April

Interest: 10% per annum will be paid twice a year 

Type of bond: three-year tax-free infrastructure bond. The interest you earn will not be taxed

To participate, load your Mpesa or Airtel Money with at least Sh3, 000 and ensure you have some extra money to cater for the cost of buying the bond via mobile money. Then dial *899# from Safaricom or Airtel and follow the instructions.

You will be able to buy the bond any day between 23rd March to 10th April or until the government raises the target amount of Sh150 million. Remember the minimum is Sh3, 000 then amounts over Sh3, 000 in multiples of Sh100 and maximum is Sh140, 000.

Investors, who miss out on buying the bond by 10th April will have the option of buying it in the secondary market at the Nairobi Stock Exchange.

Upon maturity of the bond in March 2020, the principal amount you invested and the interest you have earned from the bond will be paid through your mobile.

3/22/17, 5:24 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: Are you familiar with drones (maximum flight time and radius from controller), tow trucking companies (dispatching), uber and concierge services?
Do you know what concierge services are?
3/22/17, 5:25 PM - ‪+254 790 493937‬: James, let's talk innovation not breaks to it.
3/22/17, 5:29 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: There was zero innovation there.
The car had a concierge service. Most US car alarm companies now do that. They used drones like most Ugandan music videos. They called uber and a tow truck. Settled insurance using a smartphone.
I could do the last three using services mtn offers TODAY. 
So, where is the innovation? 
Car sensors?  Talk to the tambula guys at thinvoid. Kaizi calls it vehicle telemetrics or some such.
So, where is the innovation?
3/22/17, 5:32 PM - ‪+254 790 493937‬: That's called resistance.
3/22/17, 5:34 PM - ‪+254 790 493937‬: @256783354036  great, so produce one such solution for us. Its needed.
3/22/17, 5:35 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: What kind of solution are you looking for?
3/22/17, 5:37 PM - ‪+254 790 493937‬: Ohh please
3/22/17, 5:37 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: I am not resisting. I am actually rejecting. I see no innovation. I in fact see false advertising. That is why the ad is about integration and not about a solution.
3/22/17, 5:38 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: I am serious. 
James S K Makumbi, serial entrepreneur, innovator and software developer speaking here.
WHAT SOLUTION ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?
3/22/17, 5:39 PM - ‪+1 (347) 331-2399‬: James, I think innovation in this case = the magic to get basic services to work together SEAMLESSLY -
3/22/17, 5:39 PM - ‪+254 790 493937‬: @256783354036  find us a matching local solution
3/22/17, 5:40 PM - ‪+256 792 385000‬: @256783354036  u mentioned ur fasting
3/22/17, 5:41 PM - ‪+256 776 553260‬: Are you willing to pay for the innovation... Even better advance payment to enable the innovation
3/22/17, 5:42 PM - ‪+254 790 493937‬: First show us what you have, then talk payment
3/22/17, 5:44 PM - ‪+1 (347) 331-2399‬: Obviously, this is magical for us, as for all the tech, and for all the knowledge, the fact that w still dont have these things WORKING, let alone SEAMLESSLY...
3/22/17, 5:44 PM - ‪+254 790 493937‬: I insist bse this might be the start of a very huge project bwana Makumbi
3/22/17, 5:44 PM - ‪+256 776 553260‬: I don't have a solution - those that do probably are not there but are looking for early adoptera
3/22/17, 5:45 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: And my response was that solution doesn't exist.
3/22/17, 5:45 PM - ‪+1 (347) 331-2399‬: ...the chaps who use KCCA's app to read plates did not consider that adding that to a face plate cam reader would solve our issues, and then you can apprehend the culprit 1km ahead, with no disruption to traffic
3/22/17, 5:45 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: Eh yes.
Thanks
3/22/17, 5:46 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: I already have a huge project
3/22/17, 5:46 PM - ‪+1 (347) 331-2399‬: when URA said they were automating payments, they did not consider that a barcode could and should be readable at a basic bank, so you still have to print the automated payment receipt in order for it to FULLY function
3/22/17, 5:46 PM - ‪+1 (347) 331-2399‬: there are hundreds of examples where you would be surprised what we have settled for when we say innovation
3/22/17, 5:47 PM - ‪+1 (347) 331-2399‬: ...and when we claim innovation as a result of automation
3/22/17, 5:47 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: Kcca has working numberplate recognition?  That system failed for multiplex
3/22/17, 5:47 PM - ‪+254 790 493937‬: Bwana Makumbi finish the fasting n then come back
3/22/17, 5:49 PM - ‪+1 (347) 331-2399‬: why go thru the hustle of a National ID if you could not complete the loop by having a data chip in it... imagine what we could achieve on a 5 sq mm strip of aluminium...
3/22/17, 5:50 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: Who is willing to pay for concierge services? @254790493937, where is the money for that service?  Is Dr Davis here to tell us how well it works for health?
Ssebo @254790493937 give me a valid problem and I will give you a solution.
3/22/17, 5:51 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: You have no idea the challenges. Because I am fasting (no rants) I will only scratch the surface with regards to government Innovation. 

Silos. That is why most government projects fail. Silos.
3/22/17, 5:52 PM - ‪+1 (347) 331-2399‬: Hmmm, this is going south, fast!
3/22/17, 5:57 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: Seriously, the numberplate recognition thing works?
3/22/17, 5:57 PM - ‪+256 782 098447‬: @256792603115 Dr Davis is here
3/22/17, 6:03 PM - Davis: Present.
3/22/17, 6:15 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: Hi @256792603115, it has been a while. I was just saying that the video linked above was merely concierge services and you would be best to talk about it.
Can we benefit from your experience?
3/22/17, 6:40 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: http://pctechmag.com/2017/03/uganda-ranked-7th-top-internet-using-country-in-africa/
3/22/17, 6:41 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: I think that statistic is wrong for Uganda. I have something different from ubos
3/22/17, 6:42 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: What does access to Internet mean?  Does it differ from usage?
3/22/17, 6:44 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: That statistic is more likely our usage and our access is a lot higher.
3/23/17, 8:37 AM - ‪+256 776 726609‬: *WiFi Password Cracker* - Members, I am in need of a password cracker to help me test the security of a client's Wireless Network. It should be able to run on a Mac. Any recommendations?
3/23/17, 8:38 AM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: You need a network auditing tool. Or suite.
3/23/17, 8:39 AM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: The best stuff is usually Linux based. It would need to be compatible to whatever WiFi card you are using.
3/23/17, 8:42 AM - ‪+256 776 726609‬: Can it crack the pwds ? The one I have just sniffs
3/23/17, 8:45 AM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: The ones I use range from apps to entire operating systems. I will have to get back to you. I stopped cracking WiFi when they moved from WEP. It takes longer now to crack WiFi.
3/23/17, 8:57 AM - ‪+256 776 726609‬: Tx. Let me continue my search online. Hope you get something for me.
3/23/17, 8:58 AM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: That Mac requirement will be tricky
3/23/17, 9:00 AM - ‪+256 752 608809‬: just get Kali Linux install in yo machine ofcourse not the Mac and try the tools there
3/23/17, 9:04 AM - ‪+256 776 726609‬: I only have a mac
3/23/17, 9:05 AM - ‪+256 712 002900‬: Make it a double boot so u can be able to run two os

3/23/17, 9:07 AM - ‪+256 752 608809‬: If yo system resources are good, install Virtual Box or vmware workstation and run Kali on the virtual host
3/23/17, 9:08 AM - ‪+256 752 608809‬: am sure u will easily find virtual box for mac
3/23/17, 9:09 AM - ‪+256 704 179474‬: Try using VM software en install Linux os
3/23/17, 9:10 AM - ‪+256 704 179474‬: Have u tried using Hirens
3/23/17, 9:23 AM - ‪+256 752 608809‬: double Hirens will help him much.
3/23/17, 9:24 AM - ‪+256 752 608809‬: *doubt
3/23/17, 9:24 AM - ‪+256 776 726609‬: Man, @256712002900  I have a family of one wife and three kids. I enjoyed dual booting while I was still a bachelor. With my current proggie of waking up at 4:30am and sleeping at 11pm daily, I wouldn't want to add the headache of dual booting a mac. 😫😫😫
3/23/17, 9:25 AM - ‪+256 712 002900‬: 😂 😂 😂 😂 😂

3/23/17, 9:30 AM - ‪+256 776 726609‬: Guys, am trying so much to refrain from reliving my long gone _techie_ days. An about turn might see me paraded before the judge for child and family neglect 😰😰
3/23/17, 9:31 AM - ‪+256 772 212767‬: 😆
3/23/17, 9:31 AM - ‪+256 772 212767‬: That said, I recall from my Mac days that dual booting was pretty straightforward
3/23/17, 9:31 AM - ‪+256 772 212767‬: Using bootcamp
3/23/17, 9:38 AM - ‪+256 774 434100‬: Bootcamp is a nice thing but kinda like using a missile launcher to fire a bullet. 
Use a VM and all will be calm ~ minimal overheads.  
Parallels is a nice one I use.
3/23/17, 9:39 AM - ‪+256 776 726609‬: Am already sweating.
3/23/17, 9:40 AM - ‪+254 725 054001‬: Hahahaha
3/23/17, 9:47 AM - ‪+256 752 608809‬: if u had gone VM from wen i suggested it by now u wud be done and now downloading the kali image to use.
3/23/17, 9:48 AM - ‪+256 752 608809‬: and while getting the image, get the one already built so u install as if yo installing an unattended installation. This will help u not to relive yo tech days 😁😁
3/23/17, 9:51 AM - ‪+256 776 726609‬: You assume my internet speed is great. This #Africell link works when it feels like. The pains of cheap triple bundles. 😬😬😬

3/23/17, 9:55 AM - ‪+256 752 608809‬: Ok, get an MTN or Vodafone line if yo within an area of 4G coverage. buy 2GBs of the midnight bundle at 5k set an alarm wen it clocks midnight, get up start the download of the kali (its 1.4GB) go back to sleep. I can guarantee you by 1:30am the download will be complete already
3/23/17, 9:59 AM - ‪+256 776 726609‬: Am actually working hard to be able to buy an MTN mifi considering that it is the one that I believe can offer me the best service in my hood. Vodafone is for you Kololo and Muyenga dwellers. I just hope MTN sorted out the #DataBlackHole with the midnight bundle.
3/23/17, 10:00 AM - ‪+256 752 608809‬: i used it last month and it was ok

3/23/17, 11:27 AM - ‪+256 702 563331‬: Unless requested for, but I don't think some people get the messages in the links shared.

Maybe if you get is the catch phrase of the point your driving across

3/24/17, 6:53 AM - ‪+256 702 926323‬: It's called air crack but you will need work it through terminal it's not a straight forward installation but it's open source
3/24/17, 7:38 AM - ‪+256 776 726609‬: I dont mind using terminal. Its available on my mac. Less threatening than the dual boot proposals. Please share a legit link. I am seeing a number of links I do not trust.

3/24/17, 10:01 AM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: I see the consumer protection guys have got their regulations through.
3/24/17, 10:02 AM - ‪+256 776 726609‬: Which ones?
3/24/17, 10:11 AM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: That ucc ad is the culmination of 8months of effort by the consumer protection guys to fix a problem of false advertising. 
It is very INGENIOUS really. Gets around the need for legislation by use of a "code of conduct". We should learn from them.
3/24/17, 10:13 AM - ‪+256 774 434100‬: Hi. 
I request for advise on how best I can implement a storage server to boost the performance of my virtualization server + backup to tape & cloud from it. 
Virtualization server is HP DL360P Gen8 with 12VM's on 1.2TB space and in 48GB's of RAM.
3/24/17, 10:13 AM - ‪+256 776 726609‬: Actually the process begun way back in 2014
3/24/17, 10:23 AM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: What is the predominant operating system?
3/24/17, 10:24 AM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: YIKES!!!
When I met the chair of the consumer affairs association he implied it was recent and came after a 6month consultation.
3/24/17, 10:25 AM - ‪+256 774 434100‬: Win Svr 2012 R2
3/24/17, 10:26 AM - ‪+256 776 726609‬: The first engagement was at the Golf Course Hotel sometime mid 2014 and by then focus was on Telecoms. However, gradually they found it ideal to rope in other players too. However, the last 6 months saw intense activity.
3/24/17, 10:27 AM - ‪+256 752 608809‬: 1. Ensure the storage partition is not on the same logical drive as the VMs
3/24/17, 10:30 AM - ‪+256 774 518922‬: 2. You'll also want to check Bios settings to see if hardware virtualisation is enabled to improve performance of Viritual Software
3/24/17, 10:30 AM - ‪+256 752 608809‬: 2. Make sure the storage traffic doesn't go thru the same LAN as the other network traffic i.e if yo storage is going to be standalone from the VL server
3/24/17, 10:36 AM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: What are you backing up?
Do you have active directory running? 
Are you looking for a feasible and robust data backup and recovery solution? 
I have done this for some clients and it is normally a matter of the right mix of policy, settings and user behaviour. 
I'd be willing to give you a free preliminary consultation to assess your situation and guide you on how to begin. You are not obligated to retain my services after the consultation but it is gently encouraged.
3/24/17, 10:43 AM - ‪+256 772 060695‬: 😆
3/24/17, 10:45 AM - ‪+256 752 608809‬: he he
3/24/17, 10:48 AM - ‪+256 723 074375‬: ??????
3/24/17, 10:56 AM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: Sssssssh I am trying to sneak an ad in and you are drawing attention! 
😂😂😂😂😂
3/24/17, 10:58 AM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: That is a big ask. 
This was a problem when we used hubs. But now with routers and switches,  it is unlikely to have heavy data traffic taking down an internal network.
3/24/17, 10:58 AM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: I use crashplan for my backups.
3/24/17, 11:12 AM - ‪+256 774 434100‬: I have an AD as one of the VM's.
3/24/17, 11:13 AM - ‪+256 774 434100‬: Overall goal is to have the DR integrated as well.
3/24/17, 11:20 AM - ‪+256 752 608809‬: wat do u mean?
3/24/17, 11:23 AM - ‪+256 752 608809‬: if the VL sits on a totally different system as the storage, u wudnt want storage traffic to run thru the same NIC as the other traffic. Trust me you will experience slow performance due to this. This is where iSCISI comes in.
3/24/17, 11:25 AM - ‪+256 752 608809‬: for the 7 years i've dealt with storage i've learnt this the hard way, so let no one lie to you that switches and routers will stop this. Thats why its even advise not to run storage traffic thru a firewall.  You connect the storage directly to the VL and then let the VL be the one to run thru the firewall
3/24/17, 11:37 AM - ‪+256 702 926323‬: Aircrack-ng.org
3/24/17, 11:47 AM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: Amen. 
Let's just collect offertory and go home.
Aircrack is the beginning and the end of WiFi cracking.
3/24/17, 11:48 AM - ‪+256 702 926323‬: No holy communion??
3/24/17, 11:51 AM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: Waaaaa you weren't confirmed as a hacker. No communion for you. Reverend Snowden will just smile and pat your head.
3/24/17, 11:52 AM - ‪+256 702 926323‬: 😳😳
3/24/17, 12:07 PM - ‪+256 776 111186‬: 😂😂😂
3/24/17, 12:11 PM - ‪+256 776 111186‬: Hi, James I found that ad interesting. 
please throw more light. 

Have there been any incidents that triggered this? 

Does it also mean we won't have to see those gruesome and bloody images on the front page of the gutter press?
3/24/17, 12:12 PM - ‪+256 752 608809‬: and for better throughput, its will be gr8 if the connection btn yo storage and the VL is fibr
3/24/17, 12:13 PM - ‪+256 752 608809‬: its indeed interesting...
3/24/17, 12:44 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: This was mostly about false advertising. You know,  "holy rice", "aids cures" and big bums. 
Richard,  those three things...
3/24/17, 12:52 PM - ‪+256 776 111186‬: Oh, that! 
I thought it was about more mainstream issues like "what do crocodiles eat?" 
(answer: MBs) 
😅

I didn't expect such niche issues like rice and bums to trigger UCC action. 

I guess they are not so niche...
3/24/17, 12:58 PM - ‪+256 752 608809‬: but since there's a mode of advertising called persuasive advertising such is what it entails, am wondering how contextual this case will be
3/24/17, 1:14 PM - ‪+256 776 726609‬: Thx
3/24/17, 1:17 PM - ‪+256 776 726609‬: The genesis of this was when we begun complaining to UCC about the misleading adverts by telcos that led consumers into perceiving purchase offers differently from what is actually provided. Matters were worsened by a then aggressive Warid that was fighting tooth and nail to gain market share. Some of the ADs were distasteful like the bonus wife AD of Warid, remember it?

3/24/17, 1:36 PM - ‪+256 776 726609‬: I agree. Some things start off simply, like the Aircrack installation. However, before you know it, you're spending an entire night figuring out missing libs and probably having to upgrade your OS. Let me not start what I dont want to finish. Looney Tunes, Tom & Jerry, Jake and the Neverland Pirates are all waiting for me this evening. I'll consider your advice sometime next week.

Who amongst u an worked on the greatest problem today. 

Theft  of laptops 

Who has found a tracking solution.??? ¤


0since 2015, have lost over 5 laptops and am fade up
3/24/17, 5:45 PM - ‪+256 776 553260‬: How many laptops do you oversee?
3/24/17, 5:49 PM - ‪+1 (347) 331-2399‬: In 2015 I lost a beautiful macbook pro to a home invasion - still bleeding when I think about that piece!
3/24/17, 5:51 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: Thanks for this great topic.
I was discussing the same somewhere else. How do we come up with robust techniques to track and secure laptops?
3/24/17, 5:53 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: There is tracking for most mobile oses that is now also available in pcs due to Windows 10 (one of to rule them all) but sadly, not all laptops have GPS radios and those that do are not online often enough to obtain useful tracking data.
3/24/17, 5:56 PM - ‪+1 (347) 331-2399‬: Still offering 1M to whoever will bring it back...
3/24/17, 5:57 PM - ‪+256 782 746696‬: I usually have a back and forth with  police over this. Police will tell you they would rather go after phones. The thieves now strip  PCs for parts so when police raids shops and stores they can't identify them.
3/24/17, 5:59 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: By now the 5th owner will have posted it as slightly used on olx.
3/24/17, 6:00 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: If we tighten the regulation in the industry I think we can weed out those selling stolen equipment.
3/24/17, 6:00 PM - ‪+256 782 746696‬: People have offered the original retail price even and not gotten the machines back
3/24/17, 6:01 PM - ‪+256 782 746696‬: What regulation?
3/24/17, 6:02 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: Licensed sellers with proof of import or transfer.
3/24/17, 6:04 PM - ‪+256 782 098447‬: What James Makumbi said..
But also there's insurance products to ease the pain of loss.
Ask Davis the Doc
3/24/17, 6:04 PM - ‪+256 782 746696‬: Up there I said they strip stolen laptops for parts. Right now I can't tell if my laptop ram chips were made by Samsung or whoever. License and receipts won't help when police chaps raid
3/24/17, 6:05 PM - ‪+256 782 746696‬: Insurance, more locks, good fortune and care is what we have to fall back on
3/24/17, 6:05 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: Hmmmmm then insurance
3/24/17, 6:06 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: And serious CLOUD BACKUPS.
3/24/17, 6:06 PM - ‪+254 790 493937‬: Laptop tracking tech exists now
3/24/17, 6:07 PM - ‪+256 782 094368‬: I think the biggest challenge is lack of network infrastructure through which to track these laptops
3/24/17, 6:07 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: Heheheheheheh it is easier to render a laptop untraceable than a computer.
3/24/17, 6:07 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: Sorry, than a phone.
3/24/17, 6:09 PM - ‪+256 782 746696‬: Best insurance**""
3/24/17, 6:09 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: All some one has to do is remove the battery immediately.
3/24/17, 6:13 PM - ‪+256 772 212767‬: Now you've reminded me of my MB Pro that suffered a similar fate 4 years ago...
3/24/17, 6:14 PM - ‪+256 790 267473‬: Personal
3/24/17, 6:14 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: The stories of successful recovery of fruit laptops out number the ones of pc laptops. 
Why are you guys unlucky?
3/24/17, 6:15 PM - ‪+256 782 746696‬: Feels like some of you were studied for sometime before being robbed.
3/24/17, 6:16 PM - ‪+256 790 267473‬: We need to discuss over it
3/24/17, 6:17 PM - ‪+256 772 212767‬: I even shelled out cash to a private detective to sniff around in the criminal underworld
3/24/17, 6:17 PM - ‪+256 772 212767‬: All in vain
3/24/17, 6:17 PM - ‪+256 772 212767‬: That said, I really don't know what technical approach one would use to help here
3/24/17, 6:18 PM - ‪+254 790 493937‬: Hahaha😂😂
3/24/17, 6:18 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: Truth be told, most successful recovery of stolen devices is from snatches and thefts in work atmosphere. 
Home invasions are often unrecoverable.
3/24/17, 6:18 PM - ‪+256 790 267473‬: I plan to insure this time around but which cimpsny


I heard of soko  systems  n g4c
3/24/17, 6:18 PM - ‪+256 772 212767‬: Vast majority of PCs don't have GPS chips
3/24/17, 6:19 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: But don't mb pros? Don't they come with SERIOUS security?
3/24/17, 6:19 PM - ‪+256 790 267473‬: Using IP  address n Mac  address Lois serial MO... Can't it be possible
3/24/17, 6:20 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: I pity the guy who stole @13473312399's machine. Brian actually knows enterprise security
3/24/17, 6:20 PM - ‪+256 790 267473‬: Even install prey
3/24/17, 6:21 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: Windows 10 now has Mac address randomisation that assigns you a new random Mac address every time you connect to WiFi.
3/24/17, 6:23 PM - ‪+256 782 746696‬: What if said stolen machine never goes online? Have you guys been downtown? Have any of you ever visited those small shops(pirate kiosks) that sell music or movies?
3/24/17, 6:27 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: I once had a friend take a brand new laptop for repair. The processor was downgraded and the ram halved. I was SHOCKED at the brazen daylight robbery.
3/24/17, 6:29 PM - ‪+256 782 746696‬: 😂😂😂, sorry but that one kills me all the time. I see more of that with desktops though
3/24/17, 6:29 PM - ‪+256 772 212767‬: And the sad thing is that many PC users would never notice
3/24/17, 6:36 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: That was the SHOCKING thing. It was a laptop. I will NEVER forget that. The processor was an expensive amd thus suitable for Windows 8. The crook switched it for a celeron then took the 8gb ram and put in an 2gb chip.
He then erased the licensed windows 8 and installed a pirated copy of xp.
I was passed beyond words. Worse, the nincompoop failed to properly reassemble the laptop so keyboard and track pad were defective. 
Took me 30mins to fix and made me a hero of 30mins cause my friend had never seen a laptop dismantled and reassembled to working condition.
3/24/17, 6:37 PM - ‪+256 782 746696‬: Time to accept that the thugs are now as tricky as car thieves
3/24/17, 7:13 PM - ‪+256 702 563331‬: Do you have details to your laptop?
3/24/17, 7:33 PM - ‪+1 (347) 331-2399‬: I do
3/24/17, 7:35 PM - ‪+256 702 563331‬: When did it get lost, if its iMac, I would need escort police to arrest.
3/24/17, 7:36 PM - ‪+256 702 563331‬: The only way to protect your PCs is to just install BIOS Security
3/24/17, 7:37 PM - ‪+256 702 563331‬: Even if they change OS, you'll still get it
3/24/17, 7:41 PM - ‪+256 776 553260‬: And for macs - turn on FileVault then the data on them is encrypted and secure - so no breaches
3/24/17, 7:41 PM - ‪+256 776 553260‬: Also buy insurance for your  laptops so that the only charge is for time to get re-imbursed
3/24/17, 8:22 PM - ‪+256 776 726609‬: They work with police protection.
3/24/17, 8:24 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: I normally would challenge that alleged but given the current atmosphere, I will leave mythbusting about police to braver souls.
3/24/17, 8:25 PM - ‪+256 776 726609‬: This has to be done within 3 hrs after the loss. After that time, its flagged for dismantling.
3/24/17, 8:25 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: Yes!
Most recovery success is within 2-3 hours of loss.
3/24/17, 8:28 PM - ‪+256 776 726609‬: I have two incidents that confirm my assertion
3/24/17, 8:31 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: I have long established that you are a very dangerous man. 
Someone on twitter two years ago recovered her laptop and external drive 2hrs after theft after paying 200k at cps. She found both laptop and drive were thoroughly wiped of all data.
3/24/17, 8:33 PM - ‪+256 776 726609‬: 🙈🏃🏿🏃🏿🏃🏿 Blame it on the need for survival.
3/24/17, 8:36 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: The lady went to make a report. In the timing took her to find writing materials, proof read, hand in and pay, "administrative fees", afande was already back with a laptop and drive (cables and adaptor with no bag) plus a wallet, asking, "madame, is this the one?".
They tore up her report and wished her a nice day.
3/24/17, 8:38 PM - ‪+256 774 345394‬: 😁😁😁😁
3/24/17, 8:38 PM - ‪+256 774 345394‬: Which afende is that
3/24/17, 8:38 PM - ‪+256 782 746696‬: Afande X
3/24/17, 8:38 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: I was left wondering if it was the police THEMSELVES who stole it because surely TWO HOURS LATER? 
Then the time a certain asp lost his phone and "found" 200 stolen phones the next morning.
3/24/17, 8:39 PM - ‪+256 774 345394‬: He must be investigated on the way he does his job
3/24/17, 8:39 PM - ‪+256 774 345394‬: 😳😳😳😳😳
3/24/17, 8:39 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: Instead of social media thanking that afande for finding 200 smartphones, people wanted him to answer why he was only effective when his own was stolen.
3/24/17, 8:40 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: A certain Samwiri wanted to lynch the guy.
3/24/17, 8:46 PM - ‪+256 782 098447‬: @256755425707 🤔🤔
3/24/17, 9:37 PM - ‪+256 782 746696‬: So, we can conclude that it is possible to recover a laptop within hours, we just need a finder's 'professional' fees
3/24/17, 9:55 PM - ‪+256 776 726609‬: Correct. First three hours.
3/24/17, 9:58 PM - ‪+256 784 275572‬: Lost a work Lenovo T420 years back, connected with the Afandes and they tracked through the phones of the culprits but the closer they came to getting the guy the more they distanced themselves from me.. my take is they could have caught the guy n he payed them off because he probably had sold it off long ago. ..........
3/24/17, 10:00 PM - ‪+256 776 726609‬: True. They got paid
3/24/17, 10:10 PM - ‪+256 752 607119‬: I have heard of 2 similar cases.

In one of the cases, the police chaps asked the guy where the laptop had been stolen from.

The moment he mentioned Wandegeya, he overheard someone mention a name and a location where it could be. 

The laptop was "recovered" from Nakulabye.
3/24/17, 10:14 PM - ‪+256 776 726609‬: Kampala is zoned. Each zone has a gang that controls it. Police kniw these gang leaders and sometimes use them as informers
3/24/17, 10:15 PM - ‪+256 755 425707‬: I know a person whose house was ransacked by thugs and police recovered most of the stuff. Police had contacts of categories of who steals what in the neighboorhood.
3/24/17, 10:15 PM - ‪+256 782 910474‬: Wow
3/24/17, 10:17 PM - ‪+256 776 726609‬: Happened to me in 1999. We spent a week tracking down the property from different buyers. We used to go on night missions only.
3/24/17, 10:18 PM - ‪+256 702 563331‬: So should we arrest police after the vandalism on our property. I mean robbery, theft threats and trespassing?
3/24/17, 10:20 PM - ‪+256 782 746696‬: 'arrest police'?
3/24/17, 10:20 PM - ‪+256 776 726609‬: But how? Just talk to them nicely. They also are tired of living in uniports 😂😂
3/24/17, 10:21 PM - ‪+256 752 607119‬: 😂😂😂😂😂

3/25/17, 9:50 AM - ‪+256 774 518922‬: Depends on battery sizing
3/25/17, 9:50 AM - ‪+256 774 518922‬: And cash. Some can go 8hrs
3/25/17, 9:59 AM - ‪+256 776 553260‬: Looks like the competitive price points for laptops come into play here. If you have a beefed up battery pack it could work out well
3/25/17, 10:23 AM - ‪+256 790 790218‬: It being a workstation,you should be planning for a sustainable  solution of more day 12 hours,think of that time when you will have no umeme  for like 3 days because I have seen it happen for some areas especially when it involves swapping damaged transformers

3/25/17, 10:37 AM - ‪+256 790 790218‬: You can also consider using hybrid power system that give you 3 power options Grid,Genset  and backups.This is the most reliable and system sofar  as the only time it may fail is when the Grid  and Genset  have failed and the backups are drained before any of the two is restored which is not so common.

I was looking into the sgr saga and it is hilarious. There are so many anomalies. 
That is why a tech project budgeted at 20m eventually costs 50m just to set it up legally. Not only is there a budget overrun but there are no implementation funds.
Investors and donors have tried EVERYTHING to no avail. The Ugandan appetite to eat more than his share/due is not quenched.

We are blessed as IT sector in that ALL stakeholders have a stake in IT. So if we need security, Mr Ngabirano (UPF Head of IT) will be there.If we need legal, there IT people will be there.

3/28/17, 8:12 AM - ‪+256 752 607119‬: Yeah, I have seen this, too. 

About the recruitment, I may not have firsthand info but I think some of these companies just hoard CVs like this guy says.
3/28/17, 8:15 AM - ‪+256 752 607119‬: Recently I was talking to someone in managerial position in one of the big telecom companies here & he told me they only hire via internal adverts. 

If you are lucky and your area of expertise is outsourced that is when the advert could come out via sourcing firms like NFT.
3/28/17, 8:32 AM - ‪+256 704 752046‬: Someone pointed out something about people using Nasser road papers,one of the issue  is our IT companies  are have become broke   to hire that qualified staff they  need,so they go around fishing people's CV's to win contracts  and after look out for some unqualified  staff to do work under there supervison.Actually they are encouraging nasser  road paper  user's because  then who do those people work for????.It's here where it's hard to get a job well done without issues of like going beyond planned time schedule,messing up work.Actually it has become hard to renew providers contracts for reasons fishy works  in the past and they can no longer continue with you.
3/28/17, 8:39 AM - ‪+256 752 607119‬: Probably the other issue could be down to our asking price?

With the same level of experience, our brothers from Asia (apologies in advance, if this rubs someone the wrong way) are likely to ask for only 70% of the package a Ugandan, for example, will want. 

I am not sure if that explains why some of these outsourced services end up in their hands.

Of course there are always exceptions.

And that's why you endup finding rilly fake works.
But its  the hiring people to blame most becoz they look more on the price and ignore value in the work.
3/28/17, 9:21 AM - ‪+256 776 210975‬: Every potential employee has a price value they feel fits their expertise either due to skills and training or working experience that comes with a lot of exposure. It is not right to undervalue one's work just for the sake of getting the contract. Personally I have been a victim just like many am sure of recruitment guys thinking that I am too expensive for them because of the so many years of working and a lot of exposure to a number of companies and in different countries, not considering the value that comes with such experience and exposure. They mainly look how much they will spend on me and ignore I how much I will bring to their P&L.

I remember one hiring manager at one of the ICT integrators here in Uganda saying about me that I was not good enough for the amount I was asking. Three months later I got a contract with a global player. Then these guys tried getting me back... but I had already committed. 

Industry knowledge and a network of connections is very important in our sector. And companies should really endeavour to create a balance between fresh innovative minds and experienced industry generals.
3/28/17, 9:56 AM - ‪+256 776 210975‬: Exactly. And this is very wrong attitude
3/28/17, 9:56 AM - ‪+256 776 553260‬: As a Ugandan who has hired and worked in Uganda for the last decade or so, the people in neighbouring countries have better support systems in within their organizations. Its a reflection of what is outside the company. 

I see lots of Ugandans flourishing all over the world, due to the rigors of the industry in that country ... which pushes them to achieve higher (which we can't do here)

Locally we have a pervasive mentality of mediocrity which is applauded everywhere

Rwandan ministry of Education has deleted the names of all Ugandan teachers from the government pay roll. All the Ugandan teachers are expected to exit Rwanda at the end of Rwandan school term which is this coming Friday or seek employment in private schools in Rwanda. According to one Ugandan teacher, the move has got them off guard and now they are stuck. Slowly by slowly, is puling it's fingers from a non developmental corrupt neighbor....

Back then they needed labour they attracted it now they have built their own they dont need it, unfortunately here we wont have such a strategy or may be it exists in another context

3/28/17, 2:27 PM - ‪+256 776 210975‬: URA is launching a new tax payment platform at Nakawa HQ now. Taxpayers can now pay their taxes using Visa, master, debit and even credit cards. For the first time in East Africa, one can now SWIPE & PAY tax. This is another step in the direction of making tax compliance much easier and convenient. 

You can follow the proceedings online using the  hashtag #TaxInnovations online.  

You can also weigh in your opinion about this exciting innovation.
3/28/17, 2:44 PM - ‪+256 772 212767‬: Fake news it might be but for me, it raises something I'd like to know:
3/28/17, 2:44 PM - ‪+256 772 212767‬: The East African Community is supposed to allow for free movement of labour (pretty much like the EU)
3/28/17, 2:44 PM - ‪+256 772 212767‬: Does anyone know whether this actually works?
3/28/17, 2:46 PM - ‪+256 776 726609‬: There are strings attached. Rwanda allows East Africans with a Masters degree and above to freely go there and work
3/28/17, 2:48 PM - ‪+1 (347) 331-2399‬: It works. The EAC provides guidelines, States retain the liberty to activate filters...Such as Rwanda's

3/29/17, 5:52 PM - ‪+256 776 726609‬: Dear Team,

In regard to Subscriber Registration compliance, the following have been implemented effective immediately.

Please urgently communicate to all Connect Stores, dealer outlets, mPOS agents, DSTs and any other person who does SIM registration in your territories that;

1.       Only two types of ID will be acceptable for Subscriber Registration, i.e. National ID and Passport.

2.       All new Simcards will have to recharge a minimum of UGX 500 before activating the 20/20/20 offers.

3.       All new Simcards must have a revenue generating event ( call out, SMS out, data browsing, or MM deposit ) within 24 hours, otherwise they will be switched off the following day.

The purpose of this message is to kindly request you to urgently communicate to the teams using any means possible (email, SMS, WhatsApp groups and meetings among others) for quick alignment.

Thank you for the usual support and cooperation.

Regards, 

Patrick

3/31/17, 9:36 AM - ‪+256 702 851937‬: Go to Arua park, there are many mpesa and TZ Airtel money outlets that send directly to TZ

3/31/17, 11:48 AM - ‪+256 776 912680‬: Members, in what may turn out to be a landmark shift in the IT Industry, we discussed, had a breakfast meeting on Monday 27th March with one of the leading ISP's to connect and supply internet to our private sector operators at the lowest possible rate. The offer agreed on may well be the lowest in the country so far. If your ISP is still charging you exorbitant prices and you would wish to benefit from the offer, lets go inbox.
3/31/17, 3:19 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: This is interesting. I would love to hear more.
3/31/17, 3:53 PM - ‪+256 782 619812‬: Hi Rogers, sounds good.
But I think you need to provide more information so everyone's aware
3/31/17, 3:53 PM - ‪+256 782 619812‬: Otherwise it looks like a sales pitch 🤓
3/31/17, 4:07 PM - ‪+256 752 608809‬: 🤜
3/31/17, 4:12 PM - ‪+256 776 726609‬: No. Its the real deal.
3/31/17, 4:13 PM - ‪+256 776 111186‬: Please share. Internet is one if those things that generate almost universal interest on this forum
3/31/17, 4:15 PM - ‪+256 772 873781‬: 👍🏽
3/31/17, 4:20 PM - ‪+256 776 912680‬: Totally agree Albert. Was trying to avoid crowding the forum with this by directly engaging interested members.
3/31/17, 4:23 PM - ‪+256 782 131330‬: No plse just know everyone serious must be interested in a data deal
3/31/17, 4:24 PM - ‪+256 776 912680‬: However for the benefit of all ICTAU members, we have been in discussions with 4 ISP's to get a provider who can give us preferential subsidised rates as an industry. The most competitive, yet reliable offer we got was from Gilat Telecom at US$85 per meg. This is a dedicated link on fibre. This follows a breakfast meeting we had with them on Monday 27th
3/31/17, 4:25 PM - ‪+256 776 912680‬: I hope that clears the air.
3/31/17, 4:27 PM - ‪+256 782 619812‬: This is good news
3/31/17, 4:27 PM - ‪+256 782 131330‬: Let me ask as a good student. Wat is Meg.

3/31/17, 4:28 PM - ‪+256 782 619812‬: You just be in the wrong forum 🙈
3/31/17, 4:28 PM - ‪+256 782 131330‬: I mean how big is a meg
3/31/17, 4:30 PM - ‪+256 776 912680‬: An introduction letter from UBPOA. In this case, ICTAU will recommend interested members to UBPOA and an introduction letter will be generated
3/31/17, 4:30 PM - ‪+256 782 619812‬: Good.
3/31/17, 4:30 PM - ‪+256 782 619812‬: This means one would have to be a complaint member of either association, right?
3/31/17, 4:31 PM - ‪+256 776 912680‬: Ideally, yes.
3/31/17, 4:33 PM - ‪+256 782 619812‬: Not just "ideally". We should make that "practically"
3/31/17, 4:33 PM - ‪+256 776 912680‬: I agree. That is a big member benefit
3/31/17, 4:34 PM - ‪+256 782 619812‬: Good.

3/31/17, 4:40 PM - ‪+256 791 325006‬: I'm suspecting megabits or megabits per second
3/31/17, 4:43 PM - ‪+256 782 131330‬: I doubt coz 1mps can't do anything en can't be called cheap at dat price

3/31/17, 4:54 PM - ‪+256 752 608809‬: 1 meg link ideally means you given download speeds of 1mbps for a month
3/31/17, 4:55 PM - ‪+256 776 726609‬: 1 mps may not do anything but AFAIK 1 Mbps can do something good for the average SME.
3/31/17, 4:56 PM - ‪+256 782 363505‬: I think he's talking about a pipe....not a bundle
3/31/17, 4:56 PM - ‪+256 752 608809‬: so if you are a small SME like Wire says, 1 mbps dedicated is not bad but thats how far it goes "not bad"
3/31/17, 4:57 PM - ‪+256 752 608809‬: yes its a pipe but running at 1mbps
3/31/17, 5:00 PM - ‪+256 752 608809‬: speed is speed whether yo running a bundle or a leased line etc... the difference would inly be in the connectivity. So some one running a 1mbps connection over a GSM network will fair have almost the same speeds with some one running the same connection over a fibre channel network

3/31/17, 5:14 PM - ‪+256 776 726609‬: True. A pipe!!
3/31/17, 5:18 PM - ‪+256 752 608809‬: for a normal user i.e one who uses internet for reading emails, online news, generally basic internet usage, i would confidently say it good but for a seasoned ICT person or a techie, i have my doubts
3/31/17, 5:21 PM - ‪+1 (347) 331-2399‬: How does this Gilat deal compare with the RENU arrangement with UTL led consortium?
3/31/17, 5:22 PM - ‪+1 (347) 331-2399‬: Does that mean that individual members can drag the benefits for their company or will ICTAU be recommending to GILAT dual memberships of a) organisations in good standing represented by b) members in good standing...
3/31/17, 5:23 PM - ‪+1 (347) 331-2399‬: In effect, is UBPOA or ICTAU play a role in the SLA or eventual MOU between companies recommended to GILAT under this arrangement?
3/31/17, 5:23 PM - ‪+256 776 726609‬: Renu benefits academia only
3/31/17, 5:25 PM - ‪+1 (347) 331-2399‬: True - so will GILAT be looking to break into that space, with the BPO/ICTAU encouragement, or will it start with SMEs (defn needs to be clarified) and/or NGOs or do we anticipate a net cast far and wide, and whoever wants in will jump into the mix?
3/31/17, 5:26 PM - ‪+1 (347) 331-2399‬: Rogers, please confirm - $85 is pre/post tax?
3/31/17, 5:27 PM - ‪+256 776 726609‬: I think Karebi was clear. His bargain was for the ICT companies. I doubt he is ready to manage their bigger market strategy. They have a local office afterall
3/31/17, 5:43 PM - ‪+256 776 912680‬: Incl of VAT, according to the proposal.
3/31/17, 6:03 PM - ‪+256 772 712088‬: Google is your friend
3/31/17, 6:05 PM - ‪+256 776 912680‬: From what I was told, RENU supplies educational institutions involved in Research @ US$129 plus VAT.
3/31/17, 6:07 PM - ‪+256 772 712088‬: Connectivity is always based on how many concurrent users at the choke point so many variables determine quality of service.
3/31/17, 6:24 PM - ‪+256 752 608809‬: true but that doesn't change the speeds u receive from your ISP. wat u just stated is one of the factors to consider via which link capacity to purchase
3/31/17, 6:26 PM - ‪+256 752 608809‬: tat wud be a usage issue at the client's end but not a link speed issue
3/31/17, 6:29 PM - ‪+256 772 712088‬: Interesting view it's all about user experience and not the stated speed.  ISP can insist that you have a full meg but we all know what matters.  And I think that's where we techies differ from the consumer
3/31/17, 6:31 PM - ‪+256 752 608809‬: there are tools to measure link capacity
3/31/17, 6:31 PM - ‪+256 752 608809‬: dont allow to be cheated
3/31/17, 6:44 PM - ‪+256 782 746696‬: Then we still have to find out what the 1meg connection really means. It looks like it is not clear
3/31/17, 6:56 PM - ‪+256 776 210975‬: 1Mbps pipe....
3/31/17, 6:57 PM - ‪+256 752 608809‬: told you it means you have download speeds of 1Mbps for a month

Most isps are selling 512kbps "unlimited" at 300k+ and this... guy says $85 for twice that isn't a bargain?
I miss Obote times. At least then people did not squander their "freedoms" because they didn't have any.
4/1/17, 8:22 AM - ‪+256 776 210975‬: James during those days there was no data/information explosion like today. All people did was simple emails and a few searches via yahoo, msn, altavister and simple online chatting. Today we all know the story of what consumes data.
4/1/17, 8:33 AM - ‪+256 704 752046‬: If they are in position to offer 1mbps  I believe they can still offer something  more than that,do u have any idea  on what there maximum  speeds are because I know of operators who provide upto 2.08 Mbps  that's on a dedicated E1  link
4/1/17, 8:37 AM - ‪+256 776 553260‬: Smile Premium Unlimited offers 6Mbps, for part of the package then down to 4 then to 2
4/1/17, 8:37 AM - ‪+256 776 553260‬: The offer will not make sense for everyone
4/1/17, 8:49 AM - ‪+256 776 210975‬: Agree with you

4/1/17, 8:54 AM - ‪+256 752 606511‬: So it's better I go for a normal data bundle at either ISP mainly when am a mobile user
4/1/17, 8:57 AM - ‪+256 776 210975‬: I identify with you on this... 9.6Kbps, 32Kbps 64... etc. So many offices were doing 32 and 64Kbps during those days
4/1/17, 9:13 AM - ‪+256 772 499474‬: Internet consumption demand  is elastic . The more you give , the more people will demand for more. I once used   a 1GB link and after just three days , I started complaining .

The issue is you should always manage the users' expectations
4/1/17, 9:38 AM - ‪+256 776 553260‬: Oh yes the key is to find a combination of providers that meet your needs
4/1/17, 9:39 AM - ‪+256 776 553260‬: And a level of patience too
4/1/17, 9:48 AM - ‪+256 772 181685‬: Some help please. I needed to populate a server DL380 G9 with more HDD , then bought 3.5" disks to my surprise the G9 bays are SFF. Is there any way I can still use the 3.5"
4/1/17, 9:48 AM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: I think people need to be practical and business minded. For example, what @256776553260 doesn't say about his beloved smile unlimited is that it meets his needs practically while still being financially viable. For me who was living on 512kbps and paying 300k ugx, $85 for 1mbps sounds like heaven.
But I have problems that could be solved by affordable mobile 256kbps. If I got a deal where a simcard provider allowed me 256kbps at a reasonable fixed price I would be happy.  Happy to get 256kbps!!
So these torrenting Netflix watching youtubers who think $85 for 1mbps should perhaps go outside and see what is happening IN Uganda.
4/1/17, 10:00 AM - ‪+256 772 401172‬: Sorry, the two types are very different from each other
4/1/17, 10:02 AM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: Try to sell the 3.5" drives and buy the correct ones. Chalk up the difference in price to experience.
4/1/17, 10:04 AM - ‪+256 772 181685‬: Checked price for 2.5" it's double
4/1/17, 10:05 AM - ‪+256 782 746696‬: One can still do plenty with that $85 package. Even if the speeds swing between 600-900kbps and never reach its ceiling
4/1/17, 10:05 AM - ‪+256 772 401172‬: True, the purpose is different the former being higher quality
4/1/17, 10:09 AM - ‪+256 772 181685‬: Problem is I even failed to get the 3.5" for G9 from here, had shipped from Nairobi. Trouble is I have to take the double loss now.
4/1/17, 10:10 AM - ‪+256 772 181685‬: Someone had advised that using a  USB cable I can use the 3.5 not seated in the bays

4/1/17, 10:34 AM - ‪+256 752 608809‬: but James, you sound like a stone age guy. lets for a second consider the advancement and sophisication to which a web browser has gone today. with flash sites and google ads running on sites and knowing that a web browser now does client server communication without the actual hardware sockets getting involved tell me how long it takes a 512Kbps link to open such a web browser and then tell how many users dont use web browsers in their day to day internet usage.
4/1/17, 10:39 AM - ‪+256 752 608809‬: *to open a such a website not web browser
4/1/17, 10:44 AM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: 512kbps for 1 user? Come on.
I am a software developer specialising in bespoke erp solutions for desktop, browser and tablets. My apps haul megabytes of data back and forth. The need to give a user near instant feedback is a requirement. 
Yes I am "stone-age" by your narrow nonspecific definition. But I am also a solution provider who specifies what will and will not work for my clients so that they can not only use my cloud solutions but also use the general Internet (net neutrality bs) while having a good experience at a reasonable price. Based on my stone-age experience, 1mbps at $85 is godsent. I am open to cheaper alternatives and I am at the edge of my seat watching each and every word you write anxiously waiting for a cheaper alternative from you. As someone on the cutting edge, I don't expect you to merely curse the darkness but rather light a candle by which all of us can see.
4/1/17, 10:50 AM - ‪+256 752 608809‬: wow wow, calm down mate. Am sorry if i insulted you or if it rubbed your shoulders badly but i didn't use stone-age as an abuse. i said you sound like didn't say you are. Once again am sorry. And 512Kbps works fine for you i accept but wont do for me. tried it and it made me lose a client. Like they say once bitten twice shy!!
4/1/17, 10:55 AM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: I wasn't offended. 
Why are you blaming 512kbps? Did you understand the customer requirements?  did younger a budget? Was the client willing to pay for alot more than the cost of 512kbps? Did you get bad 512kbps for the service provider? May I recommend this cutting edge approach to solutions delivery called "human centred design"? The clients I lose are only those I fire due to being unreasonable or breaching the terms of my contracts in such a way as to compromise my delivery of quality work.
4/1/17, 10:55 AM - ‪+256 752 608809‬: try doing remote support on that with any remote clients and tell me your client satisfaction at the end of the month. like someone said on the forum, i think the needs determine the speeds, we all cant have the same needa
4/1/17, 10:57 AM - ‪+256 782 577909‬: What's happening?
4/1/17, 10:57 AM - ‪+256 772 401172‬: I think there's a confusion between the 1 mb in bundle speak and 1 mbps speed. Those in the ISP world should explain the difference. I thought Rogers was talking about the speed and not just the quantity available
4/1/17, 10:58 AM - ‪+256 752 608809‬: He he Joshua, just a normal discussion
4/1/17, 10:58 AM - ‪+256 752 608809‬: Andrew i yesterday explained wat 1Mbps means.

4/1/17, 11:00 AM - ‪+256 752 608809‬: bundles come with the GSM medium but they too are supplied with certain speeds. I can have for example a 1MB bundle running at 1Mbps
4/1/17, 11:03 AM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: I can propose solutions to this too. I have worked in this industry for over 12 years and have picked up a solution or two to these challenges. 
Like I told @256774434100 last week, I do free consultations as a one off for customers who would like to sample Billable Limited services. Hit me up off-group to setup a meeting. We can then see if together we can work out a way to deliver remote assistance to Ugandan customers in this bandwidth and cash constrained country.
4/1/17, 11:13 AM - ‪+256 752 608809‬: 👍👍🤜🤛
4/1/17, 11:15 AM - ‪+256 772 401172‬: James, if you don't mind some of us just joined, what does Billable Ltd Svs do?
4/1/17, 11:22 AM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: Ads are banned here 😊
We are an independent software vendor specialising in business information management solutions. Our flagship product is a law firm management solution. 
Given the sorry state of our target market with regard to IT, we were forced to venture into IT consultancy in order to make client infrastructure more favourable to our solutions. That is why I always offer a free consultation. To vet the potential client and know early enough if they deserve my services.

4/1/17, 12:23 PM - ‪+256 782 746696‬: Curious, why is our data so much more expensive? Is there a way to give the service providers incentives so they reduce their prices? Is the market too small from the service providers' point of view that they can't reduce prices?
4/1/17, 12:25 PM - ‪+256 772 401172‬: More expensive than what?
4/1/17, 12:25 PM - ‪+256 780 684716‬: The first step is technology to monitor data consumption.. 

Alot happens when we can measure usage... Say 4gb By a provider..
4/1/17, 12:29 PM - ‪+256 791 656920‬: In a wedding party or public gathering, robbers will
meet the MC to make an announcement of a
particular car with registration number so so and
so, blocking them.
While you go out to move your car, some guys
are waiting outside for you with a gun. They
know you have the keys of your car.
You are then ordered to ride the car out of the
compound with them inside already with you.
Please, Do the following when your vehicle
registration number is being called out at a
social function :
1) Take your time before going out.
2) Don't go out alone, at least in company of two
or more people.
(3) Don't go directly to where the car is parked,
at least to confirm from a distance if you are
blocking another car truly.
And make sure there is a driver in the blocked
car already before you go.
4) Watch your surroundings carefully before
approaching the vehicle
Please copy and share even if u don't own a car
and save a lot of people. Thank you and God bless you.

4/1/17, 12:33 PM - ‪+256 782 746696‬: Check out Kenya for example.
4/1/17, 12:34 PM - ‪+256 782 746696‬: I would expect our prices and options to drop at least a few steps behind them.
4/1/17, 12:34 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: Because our data has much further to travel to get here than it does Kenya.
In Zanzibar I was getting a 1gb bundle at 16mbps for $1
4/1/17, 12:36 PM - ‪+256 782 746696‬: I look at zuku Kenya (out version of smile) trying to give Kenyans high speeds and lower data volume limits. I wonder how their infrastructure compensates for those last mile stories
4/1/17, 12:44 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: Because last mile is over GSM. But point of presence is cheap from fibre that makes landfall in Kenya. 
Uganda you have to pay to get a pop here then you have to lay your own fibre (because Ugandans are weird and enjoy duplication of effort. Look at mobile money). Most people take MASSIVE loans or have greedy investors leading to people trying to recoup loans or investment from day one leading to high price. 
It of course doesn't help that there is an unofficial cabal in place to stiffle potential competition by accepting the high licencing fees and taxes.
4/1/17, 12:49 PM - ‪+256 772 401172‬: Zuku layed fiber across Nairobi to enable F2Home, while most ISPs here are still relying on WiMAX, GSM and other expensive modes of distribution making it worse. Out of Kampala even 3G is a luxury
4/1/17, 1:14 PM - ‪+256 782 746696‬: Zuku has dishes, shouldn't that sort the last mile issue especially for people like us ? Fibre laying or not
4/1/17, 1:16 PM - ‪+256 782 746696‬: The fibre is in Nairobi, i have seen some of those boxes that come with dishes they have data service ports and all. Wouldn't that solve the problem?
4/1/17, 1:18 PM - ‪+256 772 401172‬: Numbers in Kenya are also very good in Kenya, look at Safaricom vs All our Telcos. They have been able to use the big subscription base to bargain for lower rates for everything including near to free Mpesa charges soon.
4/1/17, 1:19 PM - ‪+256 772 401172‬: Dishes introduce the satellite angle which we are trying hard to run away from
4/1/17, 1:23 PM - ‪+256 782 746696‬: If the alternative is 256kbps why not
4/1/17, 1:25 PM - ‪+256 782 746696‬: You can see how cheap 1mps options get us excited....
4/1/17, 1:27 PM - ‪+256 772 401172‬: Satellite 512+ is not cheap
4/1/17, 1:28 PM - ‪+256 704 752046‬: Personally I keep wondering  what new thing Google  brought,we thought by laying there fibre around  kampala  Internet  was to become cheap  suprisingly  the best they have is the WIFI now Roke  telecom and leasing there fibre.
4/1/17, 1:29 PM - ‪+256 782 746696‬: Depends on who they sell to and what the reseller decided to do
4/1/17, 1:31 PM - ‪+256 782 746696‬: Neither are the alternatives from where we stand
4/1/17, 1:33 PM - ‪+256 772 401172‬: Anyone here knows if they are still planning to extend the same
4/1/17, 1:39 PM - ‪+256 704 752046‬: The last time I worked with them,they had plans for pushing it to jinja
4/1/17, 1:40 PM - ‪+256 782 746696‬: Didn't they close their fibre projects ?
4/1/17, 1:43 PM - ‪+256 704 752046‬: It's still running in high gear,actauuly now using there fibre to connect telecom companies as they are now entirely migrating form MW  links transmission  to fibre for kampala,some parts of wakiso  and entebbe
4/1/17, 1:44 PM - ‪+256 704 752046‬: #telecom  sites
4/1/17, 1:47 PM - ‪+256 704 752046‬: That's why of late around kampala,you realize  Microwaves have been put out use and now replace by Google fibre
4/1/17, 1:48 PM - ‪+256 704 752046‬: #replaced
4/1/17, 2:08 PM - ‪+256 782 746696‬: Something still does not add up. Even with Google help i would expect us to cheer for 10mbps not 1mbps
4/1/17, 2:15 PM - ‪+256 743 076458‬: Well it all doesnt make sense.....dnt see tht much improvement happening mostly to the common user those at the last end...

4/1/17, 6:07 PM - ‪+256 782 098447‬: You look at the back for a break in the cover and pull it open

4/1/17, 10:49 PM - ‪+256 782 285883‬: Just thinking that there are policies and law regarding govt information and access. Article 41 of the constitution allows for persons to access information from the state but rather silent on what intention of the information. We all know that telecoms need this information unfortunately we cannot know what the telecoms are going to do with such information
4/1/17, 10:57 PM - ‪+256 776 210975‬: I listened to an Observer employee talking about the break in that happened at their offices. He said that they had last backed up five days ago, meaning they lost all they had not backed up apart from what is people's heads.

Why don't people develop a culture of real time back up or better still go cloud?

This is a news paper organizations for crying out aloud. 

Your thoughts.
4/1/17, 11:04 PM - ‪+256 776 912680‬: Data protection laws not applicable yet. What was passed may not come in handy on this.
4/1/17, 11:11 PM - ‪+256 782 746696‬: Same as the breakins the human rights chaps have had
4/1/17, 11:18 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: Isn't that the wrong direction? 
Telcos should give government data. Or gov should have availed a limited api strictly for verification
4/1/17, 11:30 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: Phone numbers should have been added to national IDs not national IDs to phone numbers. Unless numbers are going to become the rpimary key for ID records.
4/2/17, 12:48 AM - ‪+256 782 746696‬: Depends on which side. To government it's your IDs first then your phone numbers and other information. Although i remember the SIM registration form having something similar
4/2/17, 1:01 AM - ‪+256 775 623646‬: Hello ICTAU, anyone here with experience on webservices / APIs development or management? Need some help

I understand private inbox isn't allowed here. Maybe I should say contact off list for technical discussions.
4/2/17, 8:11 AM - ‪+256 772 712088‬: We have to advance our ideas beyond social media conversations to well thought through policy suggestions. We then have a number of channels to get these ideas into the mainstream. The minister is too busy to get any value from our list. The challenge is are we ready to give our ideas more than the 5 mins it takes us to think out loud or a day a topic trends
4/2/17, 8:12 AM - ‪+256 772 712088‬: In short as in industry we have become all talk
4/2/17, 8:13 AM - ‪+256 782 619812‬: I think real value will be realized once we achieve a structure in which our discussions form part of the policy-formulation process.

4/2/17, 10:30 AM - ‪+256 752 608809‬: I think this is where our government gets it wrong. my opinion would be he requests one of the many ICT bodies we have i.e the ministry, UCC, NITA-U to draft the policy and these bodies then can reach out to the lawyers to assess if the policy has any constitutional bleach and then the laws will be made  using this policy as a guideline.
4/2/17, 10:31 AM - ‪+254 790 493937‬: Yes, whoever is misadvising govt... But we need to scrutinise the aims n you will notice some huge glaring gaps of insecurity in this move.
4/2/17, 10:31 AM - ‪+256 776 912680‬: Talking of national IDs. Does TZ accept national IDs as travel documents? Have used mine to go to Kenya and Rwanda. Not sure of TZ.

4/2/17, 11:18 AM - ‪+256 782 746696‬: Still you would want to carry a passport. Just in case their lively president decides he is the chief of immigration and travel during the time you are over there
4/2/17, 11:19 AM - ‪+256 776 912680‬: But am advised a passport can now be renewed express in 3 working days at 300K. Yes?
4/2/17, 11:21 AM - ‪+256 776 553260‬: Yes... Not sure about Kampala but I can confirm I did it in Mbarara in May last year
4/2/17, 11:22 AM - ‪+256 776 912680‬: Thanks SSM.
4/2/17, 11:22 AM - ‪+256 782 746696‬: Give it a week just to be sure.

4/2/17, 11:24 AM - ‪+256 776 111186‬: It took me longer to get LC1/2/3 stamps than to get passport
4/2/17, 11:25 AM - ‪+256 776 912680‬: Richard, was that a new one or renewal?
4/2/17, 11:26 AM - ‪+256 776 111186‬: Renewal
4/2/17, 11:28 AM - ‪+256 788 920178‬: I got mine in two, depends on who you know there
4/2/17, 11:29 AM - ‪+256 776 912680‬: Ok.
4/2/17, 11:29 AM - ‪+256 776 912680‬: And you needed LC letters for renewal?
4/2/17, 11:29 AM - ‪+256 776 111186‬: 3 days. No technical know who
4/2/17, 11:29 AM - ‪+256 776 111186‬: Yes

4/2/17, 1:19 PM - ‪+256 772 712088‬: Not sure the national ids as travel documents were outcomes of northern corridor which Tanzania had not signed up to
4/2/17, 1:20 PM - ‪+256 776 912680‬: So TZ is not a signatory, right?
4/2/17, 1:21 PM - ‪+256 772 712088‬: Northern corridor was escalating EAC PROJECTS so they are signatories but not yet activated
4/2/17, 1:22 PM - ‪+256 776 912680‬: Ok, let me work on renewing my PP at the earliest.
4/2/17, 1:23 PM - ‪+256 772 712088‬: But you can use the temporary travel document for Tz
4/2/17, 1:23 PM - ‪+256 776 912680‬: Ok, thats a breather, thanks.
4/2/17, 1:28 PM - ‪+256 792 801124‬: They will bounce you with just a national ID.  A friend was bounced in Feb this year at the border.
4/2/17, 1:39 PM - ‪+256 704 195544‬: Dont forget the $200 for a business visa if you intended to stay for more than 6 days in business meetings. Guys at Namanga border are not a joking subject.
4/2/17, 1:40 PM - ‪+256 776 912680‬: But a tourist visa is US$40, right?
4/2/17, 1:41 PM - ‪+256 782 861382‬: No they are not needed. Just fill the form and pay the fees. You need a recommendation( anyone)
4/2/17, 1:42 PM - ‪+256 783 354036‬: I renewed mine without going to lc. I did get a letter of recommendation though.
4/2/17, 1:42 PM - ‪+256 782 861382‬: Was it renewal or new passport? I just renewed mine in Jan this year and didn't need the LC letters
4/2/17, 1:43 PM - ‪+256 782 925960‬: Used national ID last week but one and had no issues both Kenya and tanzania. Was there for three weeks.. Without passport, u have to get issued that other travel document- slip. Though ure looks should identify u as person without a passport.
4/2/17, 1:44 PM - ‪+256 776 912680‬: Used it to go to TZ?
4/2/17, 1:46 PM - ‪+256 782 925960‬: Yes I used it to go to tz and later connected to Kenya where I spent just 4 days.
4/2/17, 1:46 PM - ‪+256 776 912680‬: Ok
4/2/17, 1:48 PM - ‪+256 782 577909‬: You guys are risk takers
4/2/17, 1:49 PM - ‪+256 772 533848‬: You didn't use the ID, you used the temporary travel slip. The ID by itself doesn't suffice.
4/2/17, 1:50 PM - ‪+256 772 533848‬: For TZ
4/2/17, 1:51 PM - ‪+256 756 321183‬: True, ID will only work for Kenya and Rwanda not TZ
4/2/17, 2:17 PM - ‪+256 772 401172‬: East African residents don't need to pay for visas as long as they have a valid travel document, actually most Commonwealth other than Canada, Australia and the UK

4/2/17, 2:24 PM - ‪+254 790 493937‬: If that's TZ, to hell.
4/2/17, 2:24 PM - ‪+256 704 195544‬: Had some proposals to share with business partners in Arusha
4/2/17, 2:25 PM - ‪+256 776 912680‬: So purpose was business, right?
4/2/17, 2:26 PM - ‪+256 704 195544‬: Yeah. That's what the immigration officer termed my four day visit.
4/2/17, 2:28 PM - ‪+256 792 801124‬: Sometimes how you identify yourself and the purpose of your visit matters
4/2/17, 2:28 PM - ‪+256 776 912680‬: True.
4/2/17, 2:29 PM - ‪+256 704 195544‬: True.
4/2/17, 2:29 PM - ‪+254 790 493937‬: This doesn't stop u from being East African
4/2/17, 2:30 PM - ‪+256 776 912680‬: Those guys are not overly bothered about East African things
4/2/17, 2:30 PM - ‪+256 772 401172‬: You didn't have to say it was for business, any way sorry about that
4/2/17, 2:49 PM - ‪+256 782 925960‬: When asked the purpose of ure travel, what answer did u give?
4/2/17, 3:02 PM - ‪+256 780 684716‬: Guys.... East Africans or NOT... To border you have to pay USD 200 For a CTA unless you ate going for holiday..

4/2/17, 3:04 PM - ‪+256 780 684716‬: They have subscribed to all benefits of partnerships to EAC and SADC but not to free movement of labour
4/2/17, 3:04 PM - ‪+256 780 684716‬: CTA is temporary permit valid for 30 days.... and is non renewable
4/2/17, 3:05 PM - ‪+256 704 752046‬: Heheheh  you are not alone my brother,me when I showed them my national  ID  at Mutukula  border just to let me reach Bukoba  Tz which is 5km  less just to troubleshoot a link and get back,the Tz  officer said "yiko  kalatasi" now I was like since  when did my National ID  become a "paper" to them.The funniest thing was there receipts too ancient.

4/2/17, 3:06 PM - ‪+256 780 684716‬: Certificate of Temporary Assignment

1. The ICTAU WhatsApp Group is strictly for ICTAU FORUM MEMBERS to share instantaneous alerts and updates that are ICT-Uganda Related and that serve to grow and develop the ICT community in Uganda.
2. We will restrict ourselves to matters that are specific to ICT ONLY. Whereas issues of a national nature might be of interest to members, these can be shared using other fora.
3. All members must communicate to the Group and not to individuals within the Group. Anyone wishing to communicate to an individual should DM (Direct Message) or Inbox directly.
4. There will be no sharing of jokes, forwards, memes, comics or videos that are not strictly ICT related. This is because we might be disparate - culturally, religiously, etc - and rather than risk offending any member with content that they might find wrong or offensive, we should avoid it altogether  
​5. The forum will not involve or accept messages to do with Politics, Religion and Marketing of products and services. All these can be accommodated in general forums elsewhere.

4/3/17, 8:44 PM - ‪+256 772 121665‬: Good evening guys, 
Some context:
The proposal was mooted but no access granted yet. An operational framework has to be put in place by the regulator that governs how the data will be accessed
4/3/17, 8:45 PM - ‪+256 772 121665‬: The framework will determine what info telcos can access. But in any case the law mandates the consumer to give that info to the telco before they access services, so its nolonger private..in any case
4/3/17, 8:47 PM - ‪+256 772 121665‬: What this means is that whether the telco gets it from NIRA or from the customer its the same info..so it wouldn't really be a breach of privacy
4/3/17, 8:49 PM - ‪+256 772 121665‬: Hope this is helpful to those that were asking
4/3/17, 8:49 PM - ‪+256 776 111186‬: My telco doesn't need my fingerprints and I didn't give them permission to get them
4/3/17, 8:52 PM - ‪+256 776 111186‬: Telco's are a *VERY* big part of our economy.

UCC, myself and many others survive by feeding off them. 

They are likely to be well represented and their positions well-defended even if it squeezes the small man
4/3/17, 8:53 PM - ‪+256 772 121665‬: I'm not sure why a Teleco would need your fingerprints nor have I come across such a requirement.
Nonethelss, the UCC framework will determine what telecos can access.
Of course, telecos will continue to, as per their licence obligations,  respect and safe guard customer information.
4/3/17, 8:56 PM - ‪+256 776 111186‬: My Fingerprints are part of the National ID database. 
I've already mentioned UCC's potential conflict of interest.
4/3/17, 8:57 PM - ‪+1 (347) 331-2399‬: They may not but they could justify to UCC and to Internal affairs that your SIM is too central to your person, and therefore as painful as it is, they can add a fingerprint requirement to SIM registrations for all new registrations, and for the rest of y'all, pick that up from NIRA. I think Steven is clear, that its a proposal (so we need to find the journalist who has spinned this) and that a framework needs to be in place (I hope the taskforce will incude atleast 3 consumer reps) - other than that, aint nothing we can do about this, even if we screamed to hell and back!
4/3/17, 10:08 PM - ‪+256 772 499474‬: Instead of giving raw data as it is proposed, NIRA should provide an API that the telcos should use to verify whatever they want to
4/3/17, 10:10 PM - ‪+256 772 499474‬: More like how applications authenticate against directories , by just binding ..
4/3/17, 10:10 PM - ‪+256 772 499474‬: No data exposed ...
4/3/17, 10:21 PM - ‪+256 782 746696‬: Good point, if they do this it would show some level of organisation. And their efforts to demonstrate that they respect data privacy
4/3/17, 10:39 PM - ‪+256 775 623646‬: I think they are going the API way, I don't think they can actually create users on the database and grant them remote access, even it were read-only..

If not the API way, then they can do mirrored applications sort of replication where they restrict only a certain section of the data to to be replicated but that makes management of the database harder..
4/3/17, 10:42 PM - ‪+256 752 963326‬: In Tanzania when getting a tin they capture finger prints take a picture and details and the same data used for driving license I believe also for company registration the same info is referenced

4/4/17, 8:33 AM - ‪+256 772 412830‬: Good morning friends,
The debate and views on SIM card registration and sharing of national ID data is interesting. 
Just to shade some light: since the national ID is the document to be used for sim registration, when u present ur ID at a telecom, the telecom will inquire from NIRA ( manually or electronically) to verify whether or not the ID is authentic. The only details confirmed or viewed by Telco are/will be what is already printed on the face of your card. E.g.. name, DOB, gender, Picture etc. 
Your other details aren't to be shared. 
As the press release from UCC Indicates, the details are being worked on the operations of this to ensure a flawless process and of course respect to privacy.
Other private entities like banks, schools etc data enrol /register people will also be doing a similar exercise. This is not an uncommon exercise in.countries across the globe.
4/4/17, 8:45 AM - ‪+256 772 609113‬: Thank you very much for this detail. The industry I work with requires to track and share medical history for patients who receive treatment across multiple health care providers. One of the easiest way to quick get this done is identifying patients unique number across multiple sites and due to lack of national medical records number then national registration number will fill the gap. 
I see many more industries wanting to use this piece of national data.

4/4/17, 9:20 AM - ‪+256 776 726609‬: Seven years ago i laboured to help the Observer make strides in their ICT systems. Somehow the interest was there from some circles but they failed to fully implement what has been proposed. There was a Luwum Street PC dealer who seemed to determine what was undertaken and one of the things he stuck to was the manual backups. I later realised he directly benefited from the highly manual processes.
I hope they wake up one day.
4/4/17, 9:21 AM - ‪+256 776 726609‬: I doubt this is the best way to engage them. Coming up with quarterly industry reports would be a much better option to influence gov guys.

Africa is unique, its challenges are unique, the social setting is unique as well as the market. If we do not approach innovation with an understanding of our uniqueness, we shall be relegated to *_Silicon Valley_* look alikes. Kenya is a great example where the hype given to the so called *_Silicon Savannah_* has only amounted to raising profiles of individuals without really impacting the general society.

If we can all recall, *Celtel Uganda and Zain Uganda* tried to educate some of their employees, took them for further education in _Nigeria, UK, South Africa_ and in the end how were they repayed????? These employees went to work for other companies like *MTN, Stanbic Bank* among other and let down *The Celtel Uganda and Zain Uganda* Companies
4/5/17, 9:35 AM - ‪+256 776 210975‬: Like Badru said Uganda has some of the best brains but also has poor or bad employers. Employers here do always want an already made employee whom they do not want to pay his worth. So they resort to unexperienced reaources whom they do not want to empower enough to grow in their career for fear that they will run away. 

When you empower an employee he will be loyal and will have weak reasons to leave or to underperform.

Then MTN, Warid, Orange came in and started shopping. UTL lost most of their experienced good resources to competition and we all know how the company is today.
4/5/17, 9:40 AM - ‪+256 772 712088‬: Every employee makes a choice daily to turn up to work or not to. When we are recruiting we also want to see the CV of the person.  So an employer is expecting that you have been trained by someone else. That's the nature of the game. In my business people come and go and I never worry that I have just trained you because I'm also going to go out there and find someone else who has bee trained. It's the nature of the game

4/5/17, 10:13 AM - ‪+256 772 707096‬: Higher pay (for the employee) of course is key although I never put it upfront in my discussion ... in fact when hiring I tend to keep away from that usual common question .. "how much do you want paid"   Career growth (with proportionate pay) in this murky market for me seems a good bet. I think we (employers) ought to reward good talent but there must be some sense of loyalty also for the employee to give value. As an employer when you get good talent, be realistic about when you should expect the individual to stick with you (mine is 3 years ..) and anything beyond this is bonus years ..  get a succession plan in place and let life continue when the super talent leaves. Don't get yourself sucked into a rat race about money and constant pay rise demands .. unless you have deep pockets or you are one who wants to waste time. This industry is like the business of football ..  good talent will eventually go to those who pay most.

We are contantly facing shifting markets requiring us to constantly reposition the business for maximum resilience while looking for new growth engines to support us int the future.  If i can change out entire teams and invest in training i might actually get more value and thus the reason Contracting is very popular in our sector.

4/5/17, 1:30 PM - ‪+256 776 726609‬: *Uganda’s Productivity potential*
Every industry in Uganda has had to fight on its own in order to make the little or much progress it has made. The ICT industry too had to prove beyond reasonable doubt its potential before the Government took it seriously. That is the reality of our governance approach.

We complain about not being upto standard hence the inability to export our services or even being competitive at a local level etc etc. Many are the procrastination we have as an industry. While I agree that the solutions require a multi-stakeholder approach, I also believe that we need to *against all odds* develop our capacity too.

In 2009, I ventured into food processing. I identified a product that was so poorly handled yet it had a rich potential, Mukene. You all know how dirty that product can be in markets. I got it, cleaned it and packaged it for resale in supermarkets. While there were many odds against me when pursuing that idea including the lack of decent food grade packaging material that is locally manufactured, I didn’t give up. Starting with low end packaging products, I was able to slowly grow the business upto a point where we could afford to import world standard packaging from China. While the Government policies on Value addition and packaging are still unfavourable or at best non existent, I have noticed a number of players in the food processing space follow a similar path like mine and today, there are a number of products that are produced and packaged in Uganda that are much better than those from neighbouring countries. I can authoritatively state that the Mukene products I pack are much much better than their counterparts in Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, Malawi and Zambia. Not forgetting Burundi. This is information I have received from various consumers both local and international. (And do not ask me what the brand name is ….)

What lessons do we as an ICT industry learn from here? We shall have to hussle and improve our potential one day at a time. While the scale may not be favourable to us right now, by working hard and putting in alot of mileage, we can get to the international competence levels that we so much admire. It is very shortsighted of one to expect to satisfy the children of his neighbour before his own at home. Even when you may complain that the local market does not like your products, there is always a section that will embrace them. Why not start with that?

From my interaction with decision makers in government, I have come to learn that the BUBU / Local Content initiative is very serious (take it from me). Soon you will see companies Like Oracle losing out in favour of more open systems. Microsoft too is going to face the knife. It is just a matter of time. However, for this to happen, we also need to up our game so that we can give the decision makers a high level of confidence. One of them told me that if the industry can’t have serious firms that can manage large scale government projects, they will consider recruiting their own team of local chaps who will then be tasked with achieving the set targets.

So, can we sort out ourselves starting from our business operations? Change is on the way, let us not get *_shocked_* into bankruptcy when million dollar deals are dangled amidst us. You all know what happened to one of the original ISPs in this country when they had a sojourn in Rwanda.

All the best.

4/6/17, 9:31 AM - ‪+256 752 608809‬: TAX ALERT - PROPOSED INCOME TAX AMENDMENTS 2017

The tax amendment bills 2017 have been gazetted and will shortly be tabled before Parliament for consideration and enactment. If passed into law, the amendments should become operational on 1st July 2017. Below is a summary of selected proposed amendments under the Income Tax (Amendment) Bill 2, 2017

1) Any statutory body established for the purpose of regulating different categories of professionals e.g. accountants, lawyers, engineers, architects etc., will qualify to be an Exempt Organisation. Consequently, their income will be exempt for income tax purposes. The tax savings as a result of the exemption should enable the organisations execute their mandate better. 

2) The Minister of Finance is to be given powers to prescribe the amount of rental income earned by a landlord. The amount will be based on an estimated rental value and the location of the property. The estimated amounts of income will affect those landlords who do not file rental returns and those who under-declare their rental income.

3) Deductions under the initial allowance regime, for the cost of investments in industrial buildings (factories), and the cost of plant and machinery located 50kms away from Kampala, are being reintroduced. This had been repealed in 2014.  Plant and machinery will enjoy a first year deduction of 50%, while industrial building will enjoy a first year deduction of 20%. This is intended to encourage investment outside the Kampala area.

4) WHT tax at 15% on payments to winners of sports betting and pool betting is being reintroduced. This tax on the players was introduced in 2014 but was repealed last year and instead shifted to the operators of gambling activities whose gambling tax was, as a consequence, increased from 20% to 35%. This is being reversed such that WHT at 15% is suffered by the player, and the operator pays 20% gaming tax.

5) All financial institutions, including banks, forex bureaus, micro-finance and money transfer institutions will be required to file with URA, a monthly return of financial transactions showing persons with any transactions exceeding 20 million shillings. This should enable URA to easily verify the accuracy and completeness of tax returns filed by taxpayers. 

6) The maximum amount of interest that URA will be able to impose on any outstanding tax has been fixed at an amount that corresponds to the total of principal tax and penal tax in an assessment. Accordingly, any interest amount that exceeds the total amount of principal tax plus penalty that will not have been collected by 30th June 2017 will be considered waived. This means that URA will have to double its efforts in tax collection and enforcement in order to ensure that any assessed tax is paid without undue delay.

7) The valuation of the benefit an employee enjoys for using a company vehicle (employer’s vehicle) is being modified to allow for wear and tear on the vehicle. Currently, employees who are given vehicles for both official and private use are taxed on the basis of the original cost or value of the vehicle, without any deduction for the wear and tear of the vehicle. The value of the vehicle, which forms the basis for taxation, will now be depreciated annually at 35% on a reducing balance basis. This should be great news for those employees who enjoy the benefit of a company car by virtue of their employment.

4/9/17, 9:31 AM - ‪+256 782 746696‬: You will notice how our expensive data access will keep you from analytics on that scale. I mean there will be workarounds but not as popular
4/9/17, 9:35 AM - ‪+256 772 712088‬: It's allot about the chicken and egg issues. Until you own what you have and build on it every achievement you make will be dependent on someone else.  Let's stop lamenting about expensive this and that and work with what we have.  

Let us as an industry banish lamenting and actually get on with what we have and build on that

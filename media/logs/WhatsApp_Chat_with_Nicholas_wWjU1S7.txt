2/18/17, 12:32 - Faith Nassiwa: Don't type out the app/models and app/controller
2/18/17, 12:33 - Nicholas: Jst leave em blank
2/18/17, 12:33 - Faith Nassiwa: It's even ends up providing them when you click preview, you'll how they are supposed to be.
2/18/17, 12:33 - Faith Nassiwa: Yes. First leave them blank and click preview
2/18/17, 12:34 - Nicholas: I am trying to redo the project jst to see the steps I went through
2/18/17, 12:34 - Faith Nassiwa: Have you received that invite to edit Patricia's survey?
2/18/17, 12:34 - Nicholas: Surprisingly it worked without tweaking it at first
2/18/17, 12:35 - Nicholas: Yeah
2/18/17, 12:35 - Nicholas: I don't know what to edit
2/18/17, 12:35 - Faith Nassiwa: Okay. Did you try creating stuff? Say creating a doctor.
2/18/17, 12:35 - Nicholas: Think I did
2/18/17, 12:35 - Nicholas: Y
2/18/17, 12:36 - Faith Nassiwa: Hope it's just for viewing
2/18/17, 12:36 - Nicholas: Hope fully
2/18/17, 12:36 - Nicholas: Well they haven't said anything
2/18/17, 12:36 - Faith Nassiwa: Creating had first failed in mine.
2/18/17, 12:38 - Nicholas: So it creates 2 files
2/18/17, 12:38 - Nicholas: One in base and one in the usual model folder
2/18/17, 12:38 - Faith Nassiwa: Yeah. The one references the other.
2/18/17, 12:57 - Nicholas: Hey mine has also refused to create
2/18/17, 12:58 - Nicholas: <Media omitted>
2/18/17, 12:58 - Nicholas: Same thing?
2/18/17, 13:05 - Faith Nassiwa: Yeah, so when your generating a model.  Look out for some entry that has lock and remove it
2/18/17, 13:06 - Faith Nassiwa: <Media omitted>
2/18/17, 13:06 - Faith Nassiwa: It was there where the cursor is
2/18/17, 13:07 - Faith Nassiwa: Regenerate the doctor model and it's crud and see if it will work
2/18/17, 13:15 - Nicholas: Okay
2/18/17, 13:15 - Nicholas: Thanks
2/18/17, 13:19 - Nicholas: <Media omitted>
2/18/17, 13:31 - Faith Nassiwa: Didn't get this one
2/18/17, 13:32 - Faith Nassiwa: Though it could be due to your layout.
2/18/17, 13:33 - Faith Nassiwa: Does the doctor.php in models folder extend the doctor.php in models/base folder?
2/18/17, 13:35 - Nicholas: Will check
2/18/17, 13:35 - Nicholas: Think I know where the error is
2/18/17, 13:35 - Nicholas: But was hungry
2/18/17, 13:35 - Nicholas: Gone out to eat
2/18/17, 13:35 - Nicholas: Hehe
2/18/17, 13:35 - Faith Nassiwa: Okay
2/19/17, 10:17 - Nicholas: Hey
2/19/17, 10:17 - Nicholas: Morning
2/19/17, 10:18 - Faith Nassiwa: Morning
2/19/17, 10:18 - Nicholas: Jst gotten back to the work
2/19/17, 10:18 - Nicholas: Decided to chill
2/19/17, 10:19 - Nicholas: How far
2/19/17, 10:19 - Faith Nassiwa: Hehe.
2/19/17, 10:19 - Faith Nassiwa: Not far, was thinking you were going to tell me.
2/19/17, 10:20 - Faith Nassiwa: Am stuck on the part of putting the SQL query but hopefully will focus on it today
2/19/17, 10:20 - Nicholas: Which query
2/19/17, 10:22 - Faith Nassiwa: What he did to view some records from the four tables.
2/19/17, 10:22 - Nicholas: Oh
2/19/17, 10:22 - Nicholas: The join statement
2/19/17, 10:25 - Faith Nassiwa: Not the statement but including it in the controller the pulling the view
2/19/17, 10:26 - Nicholas: You want to query the view?
2/19/17, 10:27 - Faith Nassiwa: No. Exactly what he did. He put the query in the controller then went to a view and did the for each and HTML issh
2/19/17, 10:28 - Nicholas: ü§ïdon't remember that part.
2/19/17, 10:29 - Nicholas: Oba not jst getting what you mean
2/19/17, 10:31 - Faith Nassiwa: I think you're not getting me.
2/19/17, 10:31 - Faith Nassiwa: But let me know when you reach that part
2/19/17, 10:32 - Nicholas: üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇhow can I reach what I don't know.
2/19/17, 10:33 - Nicholas: What am understanding is that you want to query for data that is in a view.
2/19/17, 10:33 - Faith Nassiwa: No, I meant the views for MVC
2/19/17, 10:34 - Faith Nassiwa: Not DB views
2/19/17, 10:35 - Nicholas: Oba you record an audio
2/19/17, 10:35 - Nicholas: You want that data in the view we made in the db to appear on the front end
2/19/17, 10:54 - Faith Nassiwa: Yes
2/19/17, 16:02 - Nicholas: Hey
2/19/17, 16:02 - Nicholas: Were you successfull
2/19/17, 16:58 - Faith Nassiwa: Nah. Been chilling out since then.
2/19/17, 17:15 - Nicholas: üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
2/19/17, 17:15 - Nicholas: Please don't copy my chilling skillsü§ì

2/20/17, 12:00 - Nicholas: Okay
2/20/17, 12:01 - Faith Nassiwa: Did you reach the part I was asking you about yesterday
2/20/17, 12:01 - Faith Nassiwa: ?
2/20/17, 12:02 - Nicholas: Hehe I think so. We are supposed to generate a form?
2/20/17, 12:03 - Faith Nassiwa: Yes
2/20/17, 12:03 - Nicholas: But in what we are echoing I don't see data types
2/20/17, 12:03 - Nicholas: Did he have data type when he was showing us on the tv
2/20/17, 12:03 - Faith Nassiwa: Have you gotten the form to view?
2/20/17, 12:03 - Nicholas: Well I created a view which is being shown but I jst created a table not a form
2/20/17, 12:04 - Nicholas: Need to create a form
2/20/17, 12:07 - Faith Nassiwa: Okay
2/20/17, 12:07 - Faith Nassiwa: Guess you'll show me tomorrow
2/20/17, 12:07 - Nicholas: Okay
2/20/17, 14:52 - Nicholas: Hey remind me of what the table we were generating was for
2/20/17, 14:53 - Nicholas: Coz if i remember properly we were querying the view that we created
2/20/17, 14:55 - Nicholas: <Media omitted>
2/20/17, 14:55 - Nicholas: That is the data that comes from that view
2/20/17, 14:56 - Faith Nassiwa: I don't follow
2/20/17, 14:57 - Nicholas: As in what was the form we were generating for
2/20/17, 14:58 - Faith Nassiwa: From what I remember he picked out some field names to be shown in the form
2/20/17, 14:59 - Faith Nassiwa: Category name, field name , field description, weight and the score.
2/20/17, 14:59 - Nicholas: Oh think I have remembered
2/20/17, 14:59 - Nicholas: Oba
2/20/17, 14:59 - Faith Nassiwa: The he was using the tool id
In the URL too
2/20/17, 15:00 - Faith Nassiwa: The action function had tool id as part of the parameters
2/20/17, 15:00 - Faith Nassiwa: Hope you  remember
2/20/17, 15:00 - Faith Nassiwa: I haven't been able to do anything
2/20/17, 15:01 - Nicholas: Yeah still figuring where to get the tool id from
2/20/17, 15:01 - Faith Nassiwa: Was hoping you get it done and I get from you guys tomorrow
2/20/17, 15:01 - Nicholas: I only generated the data
2/20/17, 15:01 - Nicholas: Hehe these guys yii isn't working
2/20/17, 15:02 - Faith Nassiwa: Please figure it out.
2/20/17, 15:48 - Nicholas: You know what need that guy to first explain
2/20/17, 15:48 - Nicholas: I am almost getting a headache
2/20/17, 15:48 - Nicholas: Even going for a lecture
2/20/17, 15:52 - Faith Nassiwa: Oh, okay. Guess he will tell us
2/22/17, 18:07 - Nicholas: You and pictures

2/22/17, 18:10 - Faith Nassiwa: Then that Python thing at hive
2/22/17, 18:11 - Faith Nassiwa: Gmail
2/22/17, 18:11 - Nicholas: Not going...
2/22/17, 18:11 - Nicholas: Mpozi when is it
2/22/17, 18:11 - Nicholas: Updates about what?
2/22/17, 18:11 - Nicholas: Let me check
2/22/17, 18:11 - Faith Nassiwa: It's today. Think it already started
2/22/17, 18:12 - Faith Nassiwa: Was having a migraine. Didn't really read them. Figured they would stress me out.
2/22/17, 18:12 - Nicholas: It was generally directed to ken and Wilson
2/22/17, 18:13 - Nicholas: But will come back to us
2/22/17, 18:13 - Faith Nassiwa: Oh, okay.
2/22/17, 18:13 - Nicholas: It's something abt merging with the open mrs system
2/22/17, 18:14 - Faith Nassiwa: Damn! Am fed up of the new issh every second.
2/22/17, 18:15 - Nicholas: Hehe don't think we have seen the end yet
2/22/17, 18:15 - Faith Nassiwa: Guess one needs to look into openmrs too
2/22/17, 18:15 - Nicholas: There's probably a million more things we are going to start
2/22/17, 18:15 - Faith Nassiwa: I know things are dynamic but there rate is just unpredictable.
2/22/17, 18:15 - Nicholas: It's more or less like rapidpro
2/22/17, 18:16 - Nicholas: According what I learned when we were at outbox
2/22/17, 18:16 - Faith Nassiwa: Really! I got it differently. More like a CMS or mini framework.
2/22/17, 18:17 - Nicholas: Huh
2/22/17, 18:17 - Nicholas: Well it about building on top of it
2/22/17, 18:17 - Nicholas: I think
2/22/17, 18:17 - Nicholas: Might be wrong
2/22/17, 18:17 - Faith Nassiwa: Let's wait and see
2/22/17, 18:17 - Nicholas: Btw how far with ken's work
2/22/17, 18:18 - Faith Nassiwa: Haven't even touched it. Doubt I will tonight.
2/22/17, 18:18 - Faith Nassiwa: Was going to ask for your help
2/22/17, 18:18 - Nicholas: Hehehehe you must be mob busy
2/22/17, 18:18 - Nicholas: Hehe I think I am almost done
2/22/17, 18:18 - Nicholas: Got the data
2/22/17, 18:18 - Nicholas: Stored it in the database
2/22/17, 18:19 - Faith Nassiwa: That's great.  The foreign key switch helped?
2/22/17, 18:23 - Nicholas: But don't know how to query it so like in MySQL it would be. "Select a.b, a.c , b.a, b.c from a join b on a.b=b.a
2/22/17, 18:24 - Nicholas: So don't know how to do that in Django
2/22/17, 18:24 - Nicholas: Do you have an idea
2/22/17, 18:24 - Nicholas: So like getting that data from the db
2/22/17, 18:33 - Faith Nassiwa: Query sets.
2/22/17, 18:34 - Faith Nassiwa: Filters and I guess value lists should work
2/22/17, 18:34 - Nicholas: Don't know those things
2/22/17, 18:34 - Nicholas: Will look them up
2/22/17, 18:34 - Faith Nassiwa: Okay
2/22/17, 18:35 - Faith Nassiwa: Guess I will try looking at it too tonight
2/22/17, 18:35 - Nicholas: Sawa
2/22/17, 22:41 - Nicholas: Hey started on the work yet
2/23/17, 07:48 - Faith Nassiwa: No. My head was hurting a lot.
2/23/17, 08:19 - Nicholas: Sorry
2/23/17, 11:48 - Nicholas: Coming in today?
2/23/17, 11:49 - Faith Nassiwa: No, still home.
2/23/17, 11:49 - Faith Nassiwa: Is anyone coming?
2/23/17, 11:49 - Nicholas: Don't know
2/23/17, 11:49 - Faith Nassiwa: Kenneth or Wilson?
2/23/17, 11:49 - Faith Nassiwa: Thought you have classes
2/23/17, 11:49 - Nicholas: In the evening
2/23/17, 11:50 - Faith Nassiwa: Guess they aren't
2/23/17, 11:50 - Nicholas: Though ken had said he was going to come
2/23/17, 11:50 - Nicholas: But he isn't here yet
2/23/17, 11:51 - Nicholas: So hopefully not
2/23/17, 11:51 - Faith Nassiwa: Thought he said he will come on Friday.
2/23/17, 11:52 - Nicholas: Haha thought today
2/23/17, 11:53 - Faith Nassiwa: Nah.
2/23/17, 11:53 - Faith Nassiwa: I remember him emphasizing our presence on Friday as he has other commitments on Thursday.
2/23/17, 11:54 - Faith Nassiwa: Hope you will be online today. Just looking at the work now.
2/23/17, 11:54 - Nicholas: Interesting on how we all heard different things
2/23/17, 11:54 - Nicholas: Am online
2/23/17, 11:55 - Nicholas: Though I jst forged things. If you look at my view you'll laugh
2/23/17, 11:55 - Nicholas: Hehe
2/23/17, 11:57 - Faith Nassiwa: Will check it out. Let me try to do it. Though have no internet on my PC
2/23/17, 20:28 - Nicholas: Hey did you manage to work it out
2/23/17, 20:51 - Faith Nassiwa: Not yet
2/23/17, 20:51 - Faith Nassiwa: Actually failed to concentrate on it while home.
2/23/17, 20:52 - Nicholas: Hehehe
2/23/17, 20:52 - Nicholas: I slept at work too
2/23/17, 20:52 - Nicholas: Didn't do anything
2/23/17, 20:52 - Faith Nassiwa: Hehe.  But you were done at least.
2/23/17, 20:53 - Faith Nassiwa: Btw did you look at the DB design for 360MedNet?
2/23/17, 20:53 - Faith Nassiwa: That is also pending
2/23/17, 20:53 - Nicholas: üôÜüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇ
2/23/17, 20:53 - Nicholas: I think we need to do that all together
2/23/17, 20:54 - Nicholas: I think
2/23/17, 20:58 - Faith Nassiwa: Seems like it's not possible for us together.
2/24/17, 05:43 - Nicholas: Hehe you up at 1 eeh
2/24/17, 05:44 - Nicholas: What do you mean
2/24/17, 09:18 - Faith Nassiwa: Meant working on the DB design
2/24/17, 09:18 - Faith Nassiwa: Morning, are you at TMCG??
2/24/17, 09:19 - Nicholas: Not yet
2/24/17, 09:19 - Nicholas: Will come in like at 11
2/24/17, 09:20 - Nicholas: You?
2/24/17, 09:25 - Faith Nassiwa: Not yet
2/24/17, 09:25 - Faith Nassiwa: Though my stuff has jam to work
2/24/17, 09:25 - Nicholas: Which stuff
2/24/17, 09:25 - Nicholas: Ken?
2/24/17, 09:25 - Faith Nassiwa: Just looked at your GitHub submission but not getting anything
2/24/17, 09:25 - Faith Nassiwa: Yeah
2/24/17, 09:26 - Nicholas: Just know I forged though it works
2/24/17, 09:26 - Nicholas: Where is yours failing from
2/24/17, 09:28 - Faith Nassiwa: At the referencing.
2/24/17, 09:29 - Faith Nassiwa: The step and value model are having referencing issues
2/24/17, 09:29 - Faith Nassiwa: at the class method
2/24/17, 09:29 - Nicholas: As in the foreign keys?
2/24/17, 09:30 - Nicholas: Not getting exactly what you mean
2/24/17, 09:30 - Faith Nassiwa: <Media omitted>
2/24/17, 09:31 - Faith Nassiwa: <Media omitted>
2/24/17, 09:31 - Faith Nassiwa: Error when I try to view the step table
2/24/17, 09:33 - Nicholas: Where is your run class
2/24/17, 09:33 - Nicholas: In the model
2/24/17, 09:33 - Faith Nassiwa: It's above the other two
2/24/17, 09:34 - Faith Nassiwa: It's working okay for it
2/24/17, 09:35 - Nicholas: Need to see the part where you are call ing the add step and add values methods
2/24/17, 09:36 - Nicholas: In the run class
2/24/17, 09:36 - Faith Nassiwa: Oh, Okay
2/24/17, 09:36 - Nicholas: What are you passing to them as run
2/24/17, 09:36 - Nicholas: It has to be a class instance
2/24/17, 09:38 - Faith Nassiwa: <Media omitted>
2/24/17, 09:38 - Faith Nassiwa: <Media omitted>
2/24/17, 09:39 - Faith Nassiwa: The id of the Run model, the object
2/24/17, 09:39 - Nicholas: Not the id....The whole instance of the object
2/24/17, 09:39 - Nicholas: Look at my k
2/24/17, 09:39 - Faith Nassiwa: Okay
2/24/17, 09:40 - Faith Nassiwa: <Media omitted>
2/24/17, 09:40 - Nicholas: So am getting the object where Id = id smthg like that
2/24/17, 09:40 - Nicholas: And passing on the whole object
2/24/17, 09:41 - Faith Nassiwa: Thought you only use .get for specific fields
2/24/17, 09:41 - Faith Nassiwa: I guess am not getting the whole object aspect
2/24/17, 09:42 - Faith Nassiwa: Plus could that be the issue??
2/24/17, 09:43 - Nicholas: I also just did didn't understand exactly how there data was supposed to be ordered
2/24/17, 09:43 - Faith Nassiwa: But your app works?
2/24/17, 09:43 - Nicholas: Yap
2/24/17, 09:44 - Faith Nassiwa: I thought getting the id references the whole existing object
2/24/17, 09:45 - Nicholas: Tried that too but didn't work
2/24/17, 09:46 - Nicholas: So you have to look for the object where the id is the id you want
2/24/17, 09:46 - Nicholas: And then pass on the whole object
2/24/17, 09:46 - Faith Nassiwa: Let me try that
2/24/17, 09:46 - Faith Nassiwa: What time will Kenneth come in?
2/24/17, 09:47 - Nicholas: Have no idea
2/24/17, 09:47 - Faith Nassiwa: Okay.
2/24/17, 09:53 - Faith Nassiwa: It's raining here.
2/24/17, 09:54 - Nicholas: Same here

2/24/17, 09:59 - Nicholas: Couldn't leave in the cold
2/24/17, 09:59 - Nicholas: Had to first put in some bed time
2/24/17, 10:01 - Faith Nassiwa: Hehe

2/6/17, 10:50 - Faith Nassiwa: Is the place chemical free now??
2/6/17, 10:51 - Sowed: Turns out, the nose can eventually ignore
2/6/17, 10:51 - Faith Nassiwa: Hehe.  Okay.
2/6/17, 10:52 - Faith Nassiwa: Though some of us are allergic. Nose might not be the only problem.
2/6/17, 10:58 - Faith Nassiwa: What do we know??  I personally would be more comfortable with Django though open to learning another framework. I feels like Wilson wants us to get to know yii2.
